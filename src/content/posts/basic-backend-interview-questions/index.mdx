This is a list of 100 language-agnostic basic backend interview questions for Backend developers. It covers the most common interview questions for backend developers, including fundamentals, databases, networking, security, and performance.

## Fundamentals

### What is the role of a backend server in a web application?

A backend server in a web application handles the server-side logic, processing requests from the frontend, managing data, and ensuring the application runs smoothly. It performs tasks like:

- **Data Management**: Interacts with databases to store, retrieve, update, or delete data.
- **Business Logic**: Executes the core functionality of the application, such as calculations, workflows, or rules.
- **API Handling**: Processes API requests and sends responses to the frontend or other clients.
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Manages user login, sessions, and access control.
- **Communication**: Facilitates interaction between the frontend, databases, and external services.
- **Performance & Scalability**: Handles load balancing, caching, and scaling to ensure reliability and speed.

In short, the backend server powers the application's functionality, acting as the backbone that supports the user interface and data flow.

### What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediary, enabling the exchange of data or functionality between systems, such as a backend server and a frontend client, by defining standardized methods for requests and responses (e.g., GET, POST). For example, a backend API might provide data like user profiles or process actions like payments, which the frontend can access without needing to understand the backend's internal logic.

> [!important]+ **Example**: A simple To-Do List API
>
> **Base URL**: `https://api.todo-service.com/v1`
>
> - **GET** `/tasks` - Get all tasks
> - **GET** `/tasks/{id}` - Get a task by ID
> - **POST** `/tasks` - Create a new task
> - **PUT** `/tasks/{id}` - Update a task by ID
> - **DELETE** `/tasks/{id}` - Delete a task by ID

### What is the difference between frontend and backend development?

**Frontend Development**:

- Focuses on the user-facing part of a web application.
- Involves building the interface, visuals, and user interactions (e.g., buttons, forms, layouts).
- Uses technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React or Vue.js.
- Runs in the user's browser, handling client-side logic and rendering.
- Goal: Create an intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing user experience.

**Backend Development**:

- Focuses on the server-side logic, data management, and application functionality.
- Involves handling requests, processing data, managing databases, and ensuring system reliability.
- Uses technologies like Python, Java, Node.js, and databases like MySQL or MongoDB.
- Runs on the server, managing APIs, authentication, and business logic.
- Goal: Ensure the application is secure, scalable, and efficiently processes data.

**Key Difference**: Frontend is about what users see and interact with in the browser; backend is about the behind-the-scenes logic, data, and server operations that power the application.

### What is a server?

A **server** is a computer or software system that provides resources, services, or data to other computers (clients) over a network. In the context of a web application, it handles backend tasks such as processing requests, managing databases, executing business logic, and sending responses to clients (e.g., browsers or apps). Servers can be physical machines or virtual instances running software like Apache, Nginx, or Node.js, and they operate continuously to ensure availability and reliability of services.

### What is a request-response cycle?

The **request-response cycle** is the process in which a client (e.g., a web browser or app) communicates with a server to request resources or services, and the server processes the request and sends back a response.

**Steps in the Cycle**:

1. **Request**: The client sends an HTTP request to the server, specifying an action (e.g., GET, POST) and a resource (e.g., `/tasks`).
2. **Processing**: The server receives the request, processes it (e.g., retrieves data, performs logic, or updates a database), and prepares a response.
3. **Response**: The server sends back an HTTP response, typically containing data (e.g., JSON, HTML) or a status (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

**Example**:

- A user clicks a link in a browser (client) to view a webpage (`GET /home`).
- The server processes the request, fetches the webpage content, and sends it back.
- The browser renders the response for the user to see.

This cycle is the foundation of client-server communication in web applications.

### What is HTTP?

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for communication between clients (e.g., web browsers) and servers over the internet. It defines how requests and responses are structured and transmitted, enabling the retrieval of resources like web pages, images, or APIs.

Key points:

- **Stateless**: Each request-response cycle is independent.
- **Methods**: Includes actions like GET (retrieve data), POST (send data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data).
- **Structure**: Requests contain headers, methods, and URLs; responses include status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found) and data.
- **Port**: Typically uses port 80 (or 443 for HTTPS).

HTTP is the foundation for data exchange in web applications.

### What are HTTP methods?

HTTP methods are standardized actions that define the type of operation a client (e.g., a browser or app) wants to perform on a server's resource (e.g., a webpage, API endpoint). They are part of the HTTP protocol and indicate the intended action in a request-response cycle. Below are the most common HTTP methods:

1. **GET**: Retrieve a resource or data from the server (e.g., fetch a webpage or list of tasks).
2. **POST**: Send data to the server to create a new resource (e.g., submit a form or create a new task).
3. **PUT**: Update an existing resource on the server (e.g., modify a task's details).
4. **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server (e.g., delete a task).
5. **PATCH**: Partially update a resource (e.g., change only the status of a task).
6. **HEAD**: Retrieve metadata (headers) about a resource without the body, similar to GET.
7. **OPTIONS**: Query the server for supported HTTP methods or communication options.
8. **TRACE**: Echo the received request for debugging purposes (rarely used).
9. **CONNECT**: Establish a tunnel to the server, typically for proxying (e.g., for HTTPS).

Each method is used in specific contexts to interact with resources in a predictable and standardized way, forming the backbone of RESTful APIs and web communication.

### What is a URL?

A **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator) is a string that specifies the address of a resource on the internet, such as a webpage, file, or API endpoint. It provides a standardized way to locate and access resources over a network, typically via HTTP/HTTPS.

**Components of a URL**:

- **Scheme**: The protocol used (e.g., `http`, `https`).
- **Host**: The domain name or IP address of the server (e.g., `example.com`).
- **Port** (optional): The port number for the connection (e.g., `:80` for HTTP, often omitted).
- **Path**: The specific resource or endpoint on the server (e.g., `/tasks`).
- **Query Parameters** (optional): Key-value pairs for additional data (e.g., `?id=123`).
- **Fragment** (optional): A reference to a specific part of the resource (e.g., `#section1`).

**Example**:

`https://api.todo-service.com:443/v1/tasks?id=123#details`

- Scheme: `https`
- Host: `api.todo-service.com`
- Port: `443`
- Path: `/v1/tasks`
- Query: `id=123`
- Fragment: `details`

A URL acts as a precise address for accessing resources in web applications.

### What is a URI?

A **URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a string that uniquely identifies a resource, either on the internet or within a system. It serves as a general way to reference resources, encompassing both **URLs** (Uniform Resource Locators) and **URNs** (Uniform Resource Names).

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Identifies a resource by name, location, or both.
- **Types**:
  - **URL**: Specifies the location and how to access a resource (e.g., `https://api.todo-service.com/v1/tasks`).
  - **URN**: Identifies a resource by name without specifying its location (e.g., `urn:isbn:1234567890`).
- **Components** (for URLs, a subset of URIs):
  - Scheme (e.g., `https`, `ftp`).
  - Authority (e.g., domain like `example.com`).
  - Path (e.g., `/v1/tasks`).
  - Query (e.g., `?id=123`).
  - Fragment (e.g., `#section`).
- **Difference from URL**: All URLs are URIs, but not all URIs are URLs (e.g., URNs are URIs but don’t specify a location).

**Example**:

- URI (URL): `https://api.todo-service.com/v1/tasks?id=123`
- URI (URN): `urn:uuid:6e8bc430-9c3a-11d9-9669-0800200c9a66`

In backend development, URIs are used to define endpoints or resources in APIs and systems.

### What is FQDN?

An **FQDN** (Fully Qualified Domain Name) is the complete address of a specific resource on the internet, uniquely identifying a host within the domain name system (DNS). It includes the hostname and all domain levels, providing an absolute path to the resource.

**Key Points**:

- **Structure**: Consists of the hostname, subdomain (if any), second-level domain, and top-level domain (e.g., `api.todo-service.com`).
- **Purpose**: Used to locate servers or resources precisely in networking and web applications.
- **Example**:
  - `api.todo-service.com` is an FQDN, where:
    - `api` is the hostname.
    - `todo-service` is the second-level domain.
    - `com` is the top-level domain.
  - In contrast, `todo-service.com` is a domain name but not fully qualified without the hostname.
- **Usage in Backend**: FQDNs are used in DNS resolution, server configuration, APIs, and networking (e.g., specifying a server in a URL like `https://api.todo-service.com/v1/tasks`).

An FQDN ensures unambiguous identification of a resource across the internet.

### What is an endpoint in an API?

An **endpoint** in an API is a specific address (URL) that represents a resource or function in a web service, allowing clients to interact with the server by sending requests to perform actions like retrieving, creating, updating, or deleting data. Each endpoint is tied to a specific HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) and path.

**Key Points**:

- **Structure**: Typically consists of a base URL and a path (e.g., `https://api.todo-service.com/v1/tasks`).
- **Purpose**: Defines a point of interaction for a specific operation (e.g., `GET /tasks` to list tasks or `POST /tasks` to create a task).
- **Example** (from a TODO service):
  - `GET /v1/tasks` - Retrieves all tasks.
  - `POST /v1/tasks` - Creates a new task.
  - `DELETE /v1/tasks/{id}` - Deletes a task by ID.

In backend development, endpoints are designed to handle specific client requests and return appropriate responses, forming the core of API functionality.

## Databases

### What is a database?

A **database** is an organized collection of data, typically stored and managed electronically on a computer system, designed to allow efficient storage, retrieval, updating, and deletion of data. In the context of backend development, it serves as a structured repository to store application data, such as user information, transactions, or content.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Enables persistent storage and management of data for applications.
- **Types**:
  - **Relational Databases**: Use tables with rows and columns (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), managed with SQL.
  - **NoSQL Databases**: Handle unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., MongoDB for documents, Redis for key-value stores).
- **Components**: Consists of tables (in relational databases), collections (in NoSQL), or other data structures, with mechanisms for querying and indexing.
- **Backend Role**: The backend interacts with the database to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) via APIs or direct queries.

For example, in a TODO service, a database might store tasks with fields like `id`, `title`, and `status`.

### What is SQL?

**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It enables users to perform operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data, as well as defining and managing database structures.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Interacts with relational databases to retrieve and manage data.
- **Common Operations**:
  - **SELECT**: Retrieve data (e.g., `SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE status = 'pending'`).
  - **INSERT**: Add data (e.g., `INSERT INTO tasks (title) VALUES ('New Task')`).
  - **UPDATE**: Modify data (e.g., `UPDATE tasks SET status = 'completed' WHERE id = 1`).
  - **DELETE**: Remove data (e.g., `DELETE FROM tasks WHERE id = 1`).
- **Additional Functions**: Defines schemas (e.g., creating tables), manages permissions, and supports joins for combining data across tables.
- **Used With**: Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or Oracle.

In backend development, SQL is used to interact with databases to support application logic, such as fetching or updating tasks in a TODO service.

### What is a primary key?

A **primary key** is a unique identifier for each record in a relational database table. It ensures that every row can be uniquely distinguished and is used to enforce data integrity and enable efficient data retrieval.

**Key Points**:

- **Uniqueness**: No two records in the table can have the same primary key value.
- **Non-null**: A primary key cannot contain null values.
- **Purpose**: Facilitates indexing, searching, and linking tables via foreign keys.
- **Example**: In a TODO service table `tasks`, a column `id` (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`) can serve as the primary key to uniquely identify each task.
- **Implementation**: Typically an auto-incrementing integer or a unique string (e.g., UUID).

In backend development, primary keys are critical for database operations like querying or joining tables.

### What is a foreign key?

A **foreign key** is a column (or set of columns) in a relational database table that establishes a link between data in two tables. It references the primary key (or a unique key) of another table, ensuring referential integrity by enforcing that the value in the foreign key column matches an existing value in the referenced table's primary key or unique key.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Maintains relationships between tables, enabling data consistency and relational queries (e.g., joins).
- **Constraints**: Ensures the foreign key value exists in the referenced table or is null (if allowed).
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - Table `tasks`: Has columns `task_id` (primary key) and `title`.
  - Table `users`: Has columns `user_id` (primary key) and `name`.
  - Table `tasks` may have a `user_id` column as a foreign key referencing `users.user_id`, linking each task to a specific user.
- **Behavior**: Can enforce rules like cascading deletes/updates (e.g., if a user is deleted, their tasks are also deleted).

In backend development, foreign keys are used to model relationships and ensure data integrity across related tables.

### What is a table in a database?

A **table** in a database is a structured collection of data organized into rows and columns, used to store related information in a relational database. Each table represents a specific entity or concept (e.g., users, tasks) and is defined by a schema that specifies its columns and their data types.

**Key Points**:

- **Columns**: Define the attributes of the entity (e.g., `id`, `title`, `status` in a `tasks` table).
- **Rows**: Represent individual records or instances of the entity (e.g., a single task with values `1`, `"Buy groceries"`, `"pending"`).
- **Primary Key**: A unique column (or set of columns) to identify each row (e.g., `id`).
- **Purpose**: Organizes data for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation using queries (e.g., SQL).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, a `tasks` table might have columns `task_id` (primary key), `title`, `description`, and `due_date`.

In backend development, tables are fundamental for storing and managing application data, enabling operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

### What is a row in a database?

A **row** in a database is a single record or entry in a relational database table that represents one instance of the entity defined by the table. Each row contains values for the columns defined in the table's schema, corresponding to the attributes of that entity.

**Key Points**:

- **Structure**: A row consists of data for each column in the table (e.g., for a `tasks` table with columns `task_id`, `title`, `status`, a row might be `1, "Buy groceries", "pending"`).
- **Uniqueness**: Typically identified by a primary key (e.g., `task_id`).
- **Purpose**: Stores a complete set of data for a single entity instance, such as one task in a TODO service.
- **Example**: In a `tasks` table:
  - Columns: `task_id`, `title`, `due_date`, `status`
  - Row: `1, "Complete project", "2025-10-01", "pending"`

In backend development, rows are manipulated through SQL queries (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to manage individual records in a database.

### What is a column in a database?

A **column** in a database is a single attribute or field in a relational database table that defines a specific type of data stored for each record (row) in that table. It represents a particular property of the entity the table describes.

**Key Points**:

- **Structure**: Each column has a name and a defined data type (e.g., integer, string, date) that specifies what kind of data it can hold.
- **Purpose**: Organizes data by categorizing it into specific attributes for all records in the table.
- **Example**: In a `tasks` table for a TODO service:
  - Columns: `task_id` (integer), `title` (string), `due_date` (date), `status` (string).
  - A row might contain: `1, "Buy groceries", "2025-10-01", "pending"`, where each value corresponds to a column.
- **Constraints**: Columns can have rules like `NOT NULL`, unique, or foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity.

In backend development, columns define the structure of the data stored in a table and are used in SQL queries to retrieve or manipulate specific attributes.

### What is CRUD?

**CRUD** stands for **Create, Read, Update, Delete**, representing the four fundamental operations used to manage data in a database or application. These operations are essential for interacting with persistent storage in backend development.

**Key Points**:

- **Create**: Adds new data to the database (e.g., inserting a new task in a TODO service).
  - Example: `INSERT INTO tasks (title, status) VALUES ('New Task', 'pending')`
- **Read**: Retrieves or queries data from the database (e.g., fetching a list of tasks).
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE status = 'pending'`
- **Update**: Modifies existing data in the database (e.g., changing a task’s status).
  - Example: `UPDATE tasks SET status = 'completed' WHERE task_id = 1`
- **Delete**: Removes data from the database (e.g., deleting a task).
  - Example: `DELETE FROM tasks WHERE task_id = 1`

**Context**:

- **Backend Role**: CRUD operations are typically implemented in APIs (e.g., REST endpoints like `POST /tasks`, `GET /tasks`, `PUT /tasks/{id}`, `DELETE /tasks/{id}`).
- **Purpose**: Provides a standardized way to manage data, ensuring applications can store, retrieve, modify, and remove records efficiently.

In a TODO service, CRUD enables users to create tasks, view them, update their details, and delete them as needed.

### What is a query?

A **query** in a database is a request for data or instructions to retrieve, manipulate, or manage information stored in a database, typically written in a query language like SQL for relational databases. It specifies what data to access or how to modify it based on defined criteria.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Queries allow users or applications to interact with a database to perform operations like retrieving, inserting, updating, or deleting data (aligned with CRUD operations).
- **Types** (in SQL):
  - **SELECT**: Retrieves data (e.g., `SELECT title, status FROM tasks WHERE status = 'pending'`).
  - **INSERT**: Adds new data (e.g., `INSERT INTO tasks (title) VALUES ('New Task')`).
  - **UPDATE**: Modifies data (e.g., `UPDATE tasks SET status = 'completed' WHERE task_id = 1`).
  - **DELETE**: Removes data (e.g., `DELETE FROM tasks WHERE task_id = 1`).
- **Components**: Queries often include clauses like `WHERE` (filtering), `ORDER BY` (sorting), `JOIN` (combining tables), and `GROUP BY` (aggregating data).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, a query like `SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE due_date = '2025-10-01'` retrieves all tasks due on a specific date.

In backend development, queries are used to fetch or manipulate data in response to API requests or application logic, enabling dynamic interaction with the database.

### What is normalization?

**Normalization** is the process of organizing data in a relational database to eliminate redundancy, improve data integrity, and ensure efficient storage and retrieval. It involves structuring tables and their relationships according to a set of rules, called normal forms, to minimize data anomalies during CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Reduces data duplication, ensures consistency, and simplifies maintenance.
- **Normal Forms** (simplified):
  - **1NF (First Normal Form)**: Ensures all columns contain atomic (indivisible) values and each record is unique (no duplicate rows).
  - **2NF**: Meets 1NF and ensures non-key columns are fully dependent on the primary key (eliminates partial dependencies).
  - **3NF**: Meets 2NF and ensures non-key columns are not dependent on other non-key columns (eliminates transitive dependencies).
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - Unnormalized table: A `tasks` table with columns `task_id`, `title`, `user_name`, `user_email` might repeat `user_name` and `user_email` for tasks by the same user.
  - Normalized:
    - `tasks` table: `task_id`, `title`, `user_id` (foreign key).
    - `users` table: `user_id`, `user_name`, `user_email`.
    - This splits user data into a separate table, reducing redundancy.
- **Benefits**: Saves storage space, ensures data consistency, and simplifies updates.
- **Trade-offs**: May increase query complexity (e.g., requiring joins) and impact performance for read-heavy applications.

In backend development, normalization is critical for designing efficient and maintainable database schemas, especially for applications like a TODO service where tasks and user data need clear relationships.

## Networking

### What is TCP?

**TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) is a standard communication protocol used in computer networks to ensure reliable, ordered, and error-checked data transmission between devices over the internet or other networks. It operates at the transport layer of the OSI model and is a core component of the internet protocol suite (TCP/IP).

**Key Points**:

- **Reliability**: Guarantees delivery of data packets in the correct order without loss or duplication by using acknowledgments, retransmissions, and error detection.
- **Connection-Oriented**: Establishes a connection between sender and receiver via a three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) before data transfer and closes it afterward.
- **Flow Control**: Manages data flow to prevent overwhelming the receiver using mechanisms like sliding windows.
- **Error Handling**: Detects and corrects errors through checksums and retransmits lost packets.
- **Use Cases**: Used in applications requiring reliable data transfer, such as web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP), and file transfers (FTP).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, when a client sends a `POST` request to `https://api.todo-service.com/v1/tasks` to create a task, TCP ensures the request and response data are delivered accurately and in sequence.

In backend development, TCP underpins reliable communication between clients and servers, ensuring API requests and responses are transmitted correctly.

### What is UDP?

**UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) is a lightweight communication protocol used in computer networks for transmitting data between devices. It operates at the transport layer of the OSI model, like TCP, but is designed for speed and efficiency rather than reliability.

**Key Points**:

- **Connectionless**: Does not establish a connection before sending data, unlike TCP's three-way handshake.
- **Unreliable**: Does not guarantee delivery, order, or error correction; packets may be lost, duplicated, or arrive out of sequence.
- **Low Overhead**: Minimal header size and no retransmission or flow control, making it faster than TCP.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for applications where speed is critical and occasional data loss is acceptable, such as:
  - Real-time applications (e.g., video streaming, online gaming).
  - DNS queries.
  - VoIP (e.g., Zoom or Skype calls).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, UDP might be used for a real-time feature like broadcasting task updates to multiple clients, where low latency is prioritized over guaranteed delivery.

In backend development, UDP is used when performance is more critical than reliability, unlike TCP, which ensures accurate data transfer.

### What is IP?

**IP** (Internet Protocol) is a fundamental protocol in the internet protocol suite that enables communication between devices across networks, such as the internet or local networks. It operates at the network layer of the OSI model and is responsible for addressing and routing data packets from a source to a destination.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Defines how data packets are formatted, addressed, transmitted, and routed across networks.
- **Addressing**: Assigns unique IP addresses to devices to identify them (e.g., `192.168.1.1` for IPv4 or `2001:db8::1` for IPv6).
- **Versions**:
  - **IPv4**: Uses 32-bit addresses (e.g., `192.168.0.1`), limited to ~4.3 billion unique addresses.
  - **IPv6**: Uses 128-bit addresses (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`), designed to handle more devices.
- **Functions**:
  - **Packet Routing**: Directs packets through routers to reach the destination IP address.
  - **Fragmentation**: Breaks data into smaller packets for transmission and reassembles them if needed.
- **Connectionless**: Sends packets independently without establishing a connection (unlike TCP).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, when a client sends a request to `https://api.todo-service.com/v1/tasks`, the IP protocol routes the request to the server’s IP address (e.g., `93.184.216.34`).

In backend development, IP ensures data packets reach the correct server or client, forming the foundation for protocols like TCP and UDP to handle reliable or fast communication.

### What is a port?

A **port** is a virtual point in a computer’s networking system used to identify specific processes or services on a device, allowing multiple applications to communicate over a network simultaneously. It is a 16-bit number (0 to 65535) associated with an IP address to direct data to the correct application or service.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Differentiates between different services or applications running on the same device, enabling targeted data delivery.
- **Types**:
  - **Well-Known Ports** (0–1023): Reserved for common services (e.g., port 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, 22 for SSH).
  - **Registered Ports** (1024–49151): Used for specific applications or services.
  - **Dynamic/Private Ports** (49152–65535): Temporarily assigned for client-side connections.
- **How It Works**: Combines with an IP address to form a complete network address (e.g., `192.168.1.1:80` specifies HTTP traffic to a server at that IP).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, a client sending a request to `https://api.todo-service.com:443/v1/tasks` uses port 443 (HTTPS) to communicate with the server’s web service, while the server might use port 3306 internally for MySQL database connections.

In backend development, ports are critical for routing network traffic to the appropriate application or service, ensuring proper communication between clients and servers.

### What is DNS?

**DNS** (Domain Name System) is a protocol and distributed system that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `api.todo-service.com`) into machine-readable IP addresses (e.g., `93.184.216.34`) to locate devices or services on a network, such as the internet.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Acts like a phonebook for the internet, mapping domain names to IP addresses so clients can access servers without needing to know their numeric addresses.
- **How It Works**:
  - A client (e.g., a browser) sends a DNS query to a DNS resolver.
  - The resolver contacts DNS servers (e.g., root, TLD, and authoritative servers) to find the corresponding IP address.
  - The IP address is returned, allowing the client to connect to the server.
- **Components**:
  - **Domain Name**: Hierarchical name (e.g., `subdomain.example.com`).
  - **DNS Resolver**: A server that processes DNS queries.
  - **DNS Records**: Data types like A (IPv4 address), AAAA (IPv6), CNAME (alias), or MX (mail server).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, when a client accesses `https://api.todo-service.com/v1/tasks`, DNS resolves `api.todo-service.com` to an IP address like `192.168.1.1` to locate the server.
- **Port Usage**: DNS typically uses port 53 for queries (often over UDP for speed, sometimes TCP for larger responses).

In backend development, DNS is critical for enabling clients to find and connect to servers hosting APIs or web services using domain names.

### What is a socket?

A **socket** is an endpoint for communication between two devices (e.g., a client and a server) over a network. It is a software interface that enables data exchange using protocols like TCP or UDP, combining an IP address and a port number to identify a specific process or service on a device.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Facilitates bidirectional communication, allowing applications to send and receive data across networks (e.g., the internet).
- **Components**: A socket is defined by:
  - **IP Address**: Identifies the device (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
  - **Port Number**: Identifies the specific application or service (e.g., `443` for HTTPS).
  - **Protocol**: TCP (reliable, connection-oriented) or UDP (fast, connectionless).
- **Types**:
  - **Stream Sockets**: Use TCP for reliable, ordered data transfer (e.g., HTTP requests).
  - **Datagram Sockets**: Use UDP for faster, unreliable data transfer (e.g., streaming).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, when a client sends a request to `https://api.todo-service.com:443/v1/tasks`, a socket is created on the client (e.g., `192.168.1.100:49152`) and server (e.g., `93.184.216.34:443`) to handle the HTTP communication over TCP.
- **Backend Role**: Servers listen on sockets (e.g., port 80 or 443) to accept incoming client connections, while clients create sockets to initiate requests.

In backend development, sockets are fundamental for enabling network communication, such as handling API requests or real-time data exchange (e.g., WebSockets for live updates).

### What is latency?

**Latency** is the time delay between a client's request and the server's response in a network or system. It measures how long it takes for data to travel from one point to another or for a system to process a request.

**Key Points**:

- **Definition**: The duration (usually in milliseconds) from initiating an action (e.g., sending an HTTP request) to receiving the first response.
- **Causes**:
  - Network delays (e.g., distance, routing, or congestion).
  - Server processing time (e.g., database queries, computation).
  - Application inefficiencies (e.g., unoptimized code).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, if a client sends a `GET /tasks` request to `https://api.todo-service.com`, latency is the time from sending the request to receiving the first byte of the response (e.g., 50ms for a fast server, 500ms for a distant or slow one).
- **Impact**: High latency can degrade user experience, especially in real-time applications like video calls or interactive APIs.
- **Measurement**: Often measured as round-trip time (RTT) in networking or response time in APIs.

In backend development, minimizing latency is critical for performance, achieved through optimizations like caching, efficient database queries, or using content delivery networks (CDNs).

### What is bandwidth?

**Bandwidth** is the maximum rate at which data can be transferred over a network connection, typically measured in bits per second (bps), such as Mbps (megabits per second) or Gbps (gigabits per second). It represents the capacity of a network link to handle data traffic.

**Key Points**:

- **Definition**: The volume of data that can be transmitted in a given time, akin to the width of a pipe for data flow.
- **Factors Affecting Bandwidth**:
  - Network infrastructure (e.g., fiber vs. copper cables).
  - Network congestion or shared usage.
  - Hardware limitations (e.g., routers, network cards).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, if a server has a bandwidth of 100 Mbps, it can theoretically handle 100 megabits of data per second for API requests and responses (e.g., sending large lists of tasks or media files).
- **Difference from Latency**: Bandwidth is about capacity (how much data), while latency is about speed (how fast data travels).
- **Impact**: Low bandwidth can lead to slow data transfers, especially for large payloads, affecting user experience in high-traffic applications.

In backend development, bandwidth is critical for ensuring servers can handle multiple client requests efficiently, especially for data-intensive operations like streaming or bulk API responses.

### What is a firewall?

A **firewall** is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks (e.g., the internet) to protect systems from unauthorized access and threats.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Filters traffic to prevent malicious activities, such as hacking, malware, or unauthorized data access.
- **How It Works**: Examines packets (data units) and allows, blocks, or redirects them based on rules (e.g., IP addresses, ports, protocols).
- **Types**:
  - **Hardware Firewall**: Physical device between networks (e.g., a router with firewall capabilities).
  - **Software Firewall**: Runs on a server or device (e.g., Windows Defender Firewall).
  - **Network-Based**: Protects entire networks (e.g., enterprise firewalls).
  - **Host-Based**: Protects individual devices.
- **Rules Examples**:
  - Allow `HTTPS` traffic on port 443.
  - Block incoming traffic from a specific IP address.
- **Example**: In a TODO service, a firewall might allow `GET /tasks` requests to `https://api.todo-service.com:443` only from trusted IP ranges and block suspicious traffic to prevent attacks like DDoS.
- **Advanced Features**: Can include intrusion detection, VPN support, or deep packet inspection.

In backend development, firewalls are critical for securing servers hosting APIs or databases, ensuring only legitimate traffic reaches the application.

### What is NAT?

**NAT** (Network Address Translation) is a technique used in networking to map one IP address space to another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit. It is typically implemented in routers or firewalls to manage IP address allocation and enable communication between networks, especially when private IP addresses are used.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Allows multiple devices on a private network (e.g., home or office) to share a single public IP address for accessing external networks (e.g., the internet).
- **How It Works**:
  - Translates private IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.10`) to a public IP address (e.g., `203.0.113.1`) for outgoing traffic.
  - Maintains a translation table to route responses back to the correct private IP and port.
- **Types**:
  - **Static NAT**: Maps a private IP to a specific public IP (one-to-one).
  - **Dynamic NAT**: Maps private IPs to a pool of public IPs (temporary assignments).
  - **PAT (Port Address Translation)**: Maps multiple private IPs to a single public IP using different port numbers (most common, also called NAT overload).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, a server behind a NAT-enabled router with a private IP (`192.168.1.100`) sends API responses to clients on the internet via a public IP (`93.184.216.34`). The router uses NAT to translate the private IP to the public IP and tracks the connection using ports.
- **Benefits**:
  - Conserves public IP addresses.
  - Provides a layer of security by hiding internal network structures.
- **Drawbacks**: Can complicate direct inbound connections (e.g., peer-to-peer apps) unless configured with port forwarding.

In backend development, NAT is critical for managing server connectivity in private networks, enabling APIs or services to communicate with external clients while maintaining security and efficient IP usage.
