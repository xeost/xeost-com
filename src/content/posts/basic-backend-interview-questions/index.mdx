## Fundamentals

### What is the role of a backend server in a web application?

A backend server in a web application handles the server-side logic, processing requests from the frontend, managing data, and ensuring the application runs smoothly. It performs tasks like:

- **Data Management**: Interacts with databases to store, retrieve, update, or delete data.
- **Business Logic**: Executes the core functionality of the application, such as calculations, workflows, or rules.
- **API Handling**: Processes API requests and sends responses to the frontend or other clients.
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Manages user login, sessions, and access control.
- **Communication**: Facilitates interaction between the frontend, databases, and external services.
- **Performance & Scalability**: Handles load balancing, caching, and scaling to ensure reliability and speed.

In short, the backend server powers the application's functionality, acting as the backbone that supports the user interface and data flow.
