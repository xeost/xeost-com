This is a list of 100 language-agnostic basic backend interview questions for Backend developers. It covers the most common interview questions for backend developers, including fundamentals, databases, networking, security, and performance.

## Fundamentals

### What is the role of a backend server in a web application?

A backend server in a web application handles the server-side logic, processing requests from the frontend, managing data, and ensuring the application runs smoothly. It performs tasks like:

- **Data Management**: Interacts with databases to store, retrieve, update, or delete data.
- **Business Logic**: Executes the core functionality of the application, such as calculations, workflows, or rules.
- **API Handling**: Processes API requests and sends responses to the frontend or other clients.
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Manages user login, sessions, and access control.
- **Communication**: Facilitates interaction between the frontend, databases, and external services.
- **Performance & Scalability**: Handles load balancing, caching, and scaling to ensure reliability and speed.

In short, the backend server powers the application's functionality, acting as the backbone that supports the user interface and data flow.

### What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediary, enabling the exchange of data or functionality between systems, such as a backend server and a frontend client, by defining standardized methods for requests and responses (e.g., GET, POST). For example, a backend API might provide data like user profiles or process actions like payments, which the frontend can access without needing to understand the backend's internal logic.

> [!important]+ **Example**: A simple To-Do List API
>
> **Base URL**: `https://api.todo-service.com/v1`
>
> - **GET** `/tasks` - Get all tasks
> - **GET** `/tasks/{id}` - Get a task by ID
> - **POST** `/tasks` - Create a new task
> - **PUT** `/tasks/{id}` - Update a task by ID
> - **DELETE** `/tasks/{id}` - Delete a task by ID

### What is the difference between frontend and backend development?

**Frontend Development**:

- Focuses on the user-facing part of a web application.
- Involves building the interface, visuals, and user interactions (e.g., buttons, forms, layouts).
- Uses technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React or Vue.js.
- Runs in the user's browser, handling client-side logic and rendering.
- Goal: Create an intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing user experience.

**Backend Development**:

- Focuses on the server-side logic, data management, and application functionality.
- Involves handling requests, processing data, managing databases, and ensuring system reliability.
- Uses technologies like Python, Java, Node.js, and databases like MySQL or MongoDB.
- Runs on the server, managing APIs, authentication, and business logic.
- Goal: Ensure the application is secure, scalable, and efficiently processes data.

**Key Difference**: Frontend is about what users see and interact with in the browser; backend is about the behind-the-scenes logic, data, and server operations that power the application.

### What is a server?

A **server** is a computer or software system that provides resources, services, or data to other computers (clients) over a network. In the context of a web application, it handles backend tasks such as processing requests, managing databases, executing business logic, and sending responses to clients (e.g., browsers or apps). Servers can be physical machines or virtual instances running software like Apache, Nginx, or Node.js, and they operate continuously to ensure availability and reliability of services.

### What is a request-response cycle?

The **request-response cycle** is the process in which a client (e.g., a web browser or app) communicates with a server to request resources or services, and the server processes the request and sends back a response.

**Steps in the Cycle**:

1. **Request**: The client sends an HTTP request to the server, specifying an action (e.g., GET, POST) and a resource (e.g., `/tasks`).
2. **Processing**: The server receives the request, processes it (e.g., retrieves data, performs logic, or updates a database), and prepares a response.
3. **Response**: The server sends back an HTTP response, typically containing data (e.g., JSON, HTML) or a status (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

**Example**:

- A user clicks a link in a browser (client) to view a webpage (`GET /home`).
- The server processes the request, fetches the webpage content, and sends it back.
- The browser renders the response for the user to see.

This cycle is the foundation of client-server communication in web applications.

### What is HTTP?

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for communication between clients (e.g., web browsers) and servers over the internet. It defines how requests and responses are structured and transmitted, enabling the retrieval of resources like web pages, images, or APIs.

Key points:

- **Stateless**: Each request-response cycle is independent.
- **Methods**: Includes actions like GET (retrieve data), POST (send data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data).
- **Structure**: Requests contain headers, methods, and URLs; responses include status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found) and data.
- **Port**: Typically uses port 80 (or 443 for HTTPS).

HTTP is the foundation for data exchange in web applications.

### What are HTTP methods?

HTTP methods are standardized actions that define the type of operation a client (e.g., a browser or app) wants to perform on a server's resource (e.g., a webpage, API endpoint). They are part of the HTTP protocol and indicate the intended action in a request-response cycle. Below are the most common HTTP methods:

1. **GET**: Retrieve a resource or data from the server (e.g., fetch a webpage or list of tasks).
2. **POST**: Send data to the server to create a new resource (e.g., submit a form or create a new task).
3. **PUT**: Update an existing resource on the server (e.g., modify a task's details).
4. **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server (e.g., delete a task).
5. **PATCH**: Partially update a resource (e.g., change only the status of a task).
6. **HEAD**: Retrieve metadata (headers) about a resource without the body, similar to GET.
7. **OPTIONS**: Query the server for supported HTTP methods or communication options.
8. **TRACE**: Echo the received request for debugging purposes (rarely used).
9. **CONNECT**: Establish a tunnel to the server, typically for proxying (e.g., for HTTPS).

Each method is used in specific contexts to interact with resources in a predictable and standardized way, forming the backbone of RESTful APIs and web communication.

### What is a URL?

A **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator) is a string that specifies the address of a resource on the internet, such as a webpage, file, or API endpoint. It provides a standardized way to locate and access resources over a network, typically via HTTP/HTTPS.

**Components of a URL**:

- **Scheme**: The protocol used (e.g., `http`, `https`).
- **Host**: The domain name or IP address of the server (e.g., `example.com`).
- **Port** (optional): The port number for the connection (e.g., `:80` for HTTP, often omitted).
- **Path**: The specific resource or endpoint on the server (e.g., `/tasks`).
- **Query Parameters** (optional): Key-value pairs for additional data (e.g., `?id=123`).
- **Fragment** (optional): A reference to a specific part of the resource (e.g., `#section1`).

**Example**:

`https://api.todo-service.com:443/v1/tasks?id=123#details`

- Scheme: `https`
- Host: `api.todo-service.com`
- Port: `443`
- Path: `/v1/tasks`
- Query: `id=123`
- Fragment: `details`

A URL acts as a precise address for accessing resources in web applications.

### What is a URI?

A **URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a string that uniquely identifies a resource, either on the internet or within a system. It serves as a general way to reference resources, encompassing both **URLs** (Uniform Resource Locators) and **URNs** (Uniform Resource Names).

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Identifies a resource by name, location, or both.
- **Types**:
  - **URL**: Specifies the location and how to access a resource (e.g., `https://api.todo-service.com/v1/tasks`).
  - **URN**: Identifies a resource by name without specifying its location (e.g., `urn:isbn:1234567890`).
- **Components** (for URLs, a subset of URIs):
  - Scheme (e.g., `https`, `ftp`).
  - Authority (e.g., domain like `example.com`).
  - Path (e.g., `/v1/tasks`).
  - Query (e.g., `?id=123`).
  - Fragment (e.g., `#section`).
- **Difference from URL**: All URLs are URIs, but not all URIs are URLs (e.g., URNs are URIs but don’t specify a location).

**Example**:

- URI (URL): `https://api.todo-service.com/v1/tasks?id=123`
- URI (URN): `urn:uuid:6e8bc430-9c3a-11d9-9669-0800200c9a66`

In backend development, URIs are used to define endpoints or resources in APIs and systems.

### What is FQDN?

An **FQDN** (Fully Qualified Domain Name) is the complete address of a specific resource on the internet, uniquely identifying a host within the domain name system (DNS). It includes the hostname and all domain levels, providing an absolute path to the resource.

**Key Points**:

- **Structure**: Consists of the hostname, subdomain (if any), second-level domain, and top-level domain (e.g., `api.todo-service.com`).
- **Purpose**: Used to locate servers or resources precisely in networking and web applications.
- **Example**:
  - `api.todo-service.com` is an FQDN, where:
    - `api` is the hostname.
    - `todo-service` is the second-level domain.
    - `com` is the top-level domain.
  - In contrast, `todo-service.com` is a domain name but not fully qualified without the hostname.
- **Usage in Backend**: FQDNs are used in DNS resolution, server configuration, APIs, and networking (e.g., specifying a server in a URL like `https://api.todo-service.com/v1/tasks`).

An FQDN ensures unambiguous identification of a resource across the internet.

### What is an endpoint in an API?

An **endpoint** in an API is a specific address (URL) that represents a resource or function in a web service, allowing clients to interact with the server by sending requests to perform actions like retrieving, creating, updating, or deleting data. Each endpoint is tied to a specific HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) and path.

**Key Points**:

- **Structure**: Typically consists of a base URL and a path (e.g., `https://api.todo-service.com/v1/tasks`).
- **Purpose**: Defines a point of interaction for a specific operation (e.g., `GET /tasks` to list tasks or `POST /tasks` to create a task).
- **Example** (from a TODO service):
  - `GET /v1/tasks` - Retrieves all tasks.
  - `POST /v1/tasks` - Creates a new task.
  - `DELETE /v1/tasks/{id}` - Deletes a task by ID.

In backend development, endpoints are designed to handle specific client requests and return appropriate responses, forming the core of API functionality.

## Databases

### What is a database?

A **database** is an organized collection of data, typically stored and managed electronically on a computer system, designed to allow efficient storage, retrieval, updating, and deletion of data. In the context of backend development, it serves as a structured repository to store application data, such as user information, transactions, or content.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Enables persistent storage and management of data for applications.
- **Types**:
  - **Relational Databases**: Use tables with rows and columns (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), managed with SQL.
  - **NoSQL Databases**: Handle unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., MongoDB for documents, Redis for key-value stores).
- **Components**: Consists of tables (in relational databases), collections (in NoSQL), or other data structures, with mechanisms for querying and indexing.
- **Backend Role**: The backend interacts with the database to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) via APIs or direct queries.

For example, in a TODO service, a database might store tasks with fields like `id`, `title`, and `status`.

### What is SQL?

**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It enables users to perform operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data, as well as defining and managing database structures.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Interacts with relational databases to retrieve and manage data.
- **Common Operations**:
  - **SELECT**: Retrieve data (e.g., `SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE status = 'pending'`).
  - **INSERT**: Add data (e.g., `INSERT INTO tasks (title) VALUES ('New Task')`).
  - **UPDATE**: Modify data (e.g., `UPDATE tasks SET status = 'completed' WHERE id = 1`).
  - **DELETE**: Remove data (e.g., `DELETE FROM tasks WHERE id = 1`).
- **Additional Functions**: Defines schemas (e.g., creating tables), manages permissions, and supports joins for combining data across tables.
- **Used With**: Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or Oracle.

In backend development, SQL is used to interact with databases to support application logic, such as fetching or updating tasks in a TODO service.

### What is a primary key?

A **primary key** is a unique identifier for each record in a relational database table. It ensures that every row can be uniquely distinguished and is used to enforce data integrity and enable efficient data retrieval.

**Key Points**:

- **Uniqueness**: No two records in the table can have the same primary key value.
- **Non-null**: A primary key cannot contain null values.
- **Purpose**: Facilitates indexing, searching, and linking tables via foreign keys.
- **Example**: In a TODO service table `tasks`, a column `id` (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`) can serve as the primary key to uniquely identify each task.
- **Implementation**: Typically an auto-incrementing integer or a unique string (e.g., UUID).

In backend development, primary keys are critical for database operations like querying or joining tables.

### What is a foreign key?

A **foreign key** is a column (or set of columns) in a relational database table that establishes a link between data in two tables. It references the primary key (or a unique key) of another table, ensuring referential integrity by enforcing that the value in the foreign key column matches an existing value in the referenced table's primary key or unique key.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Maintains relationships between tables, enabling data consistency and relational queries (e.g., joins).
- **Constraints**: Ensures the foreign key value exists in the referenced table or is null (if allowed).
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - Table `tasks`: Has columns `task_id` (primary key) and `title`.
  - Table `users`: Has columns `user_id` (primary key) and `name`.
  - Table `tasks` may have a `user_id` column as a foreign key referencing `users.user_id`, linking each task to a specific user.
- **Behavior**: Can enforce rules like cascading deletes/updates (e.g., if a user is deleted, their tasks are also deleted).

In backend development, foreign keys are used to model relationships and ensure data integrity across related tables.

### What is a table in a database?

A **table** in a database is a structured collection of data organized into rows and columns, used to store related information in a relational database. Each table represents a specific entity or concept (e.g., users, tasks) and is defined by a schema that specifies its columns and their data types.

**Key Points**:

- **Columns**: Define the attributes of the entity (e.g., `id`, `title`, `status` in a `tasks` table).
- **Rows**: Represent individual records or instances of the entity (e.g., a single task with values `1`, `"Buy groceries"`, `"pending"`).
- **Primary Key**: A unique column (or set of columns) to identify each row (e.g., `id`).
- **Purpose**: Organizes data for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation using queries (e.g., SQL).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, a `tasks` table might have columns `task_id` (primary key), `title`, `description`, and `due_date`.

In backend development, tables are fundamental for storing and managing application data, enabling operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

### What is a row in a database?

A **row** in a database is a single record or entry in a relational database table that represents one instance of the entity defined by the table. Each row contains values for the columns defined in the table's schema, corresponding to the attributes of that entity.

**Key Points**:

- **Structure**: A row consists of data for each column in the table (e.g., for a `tasks` table with columns `task_id`, `title`, `status`, a row might be `1, "Buy groceries", "pending"`).
- **Uniqueness**: Typically identified by a primary key (e.g., `task_id`).
- **Purpose**: Stores a complete set of data for a single entity instance, such as one task in a TODO service.
- **Example**: In a `tasks` table:
  - Columns: `task_id`, `title`, `due_date`, `status`
  - Row: `1, "Complete project", "2025-10-01", "pending"`

In backend development, rows are manipulated through SQL queries (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to manage individual records in a database.

### What is a column in a database?

A **column** in a database is a single attribute or field in a relational database table that defines a specific type of data stored for each record (row) in that table. It represents a particular property of the entity the table describes.

**Key Points**:

- **Structure**: Each column has a name and a defined data type (e.g., integer, string, date) that specifies what kind of data it can hold.
- **Purpose**: Organizes data by categorizing it into specific attributes for all records in the table.
- **Example**: In a `tasks` table for a TODO service:
  - Columns: `task_id` (integer), `title` (string), `due_date` (date), `status` (string).
  - A row might contain: `1, "Buy groceries", "2025-10-01", "pending"`, where each value corresponds to a column.
- **Constraints**: Columns can have rules like `NOT NULL`, unique, or foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity.

In backend development, columns define the structure of the data stored in a table and are used in SQL queries to retrieve or manipulate specific attributes.

### What is CRUD?

**CRUD** stands for **Create, Read, Update, Delete**, representing the four fundamental operations used to manage data in a database or application. These operations are essential for interacting with persistent storage in backend development.

**Key Points**:

- **Create**: Adds new data to the database (e.g., inserting a new task in a TODO service).
  - Example: `INSERT INTO tasks (title, status) VALUES ('New Task', 'pending')`
- **Read**: Retrieves or queries data from the database (e.g., fetching a list of tasks).
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE status = 'pending'`
- **Update**: Modifies existing data in the database (e.g., changing a task’s status).
  - Example: `UPDATE tasks SET status = 'completed' WHERE task_id = 1`
- **Delete**: Removes data from the database (e.g., deleting a task).
  - Example: `DELETE FROM tasks WHERE task_id = 1`

**Context**:

- **Backend Role**: CRUD operations are typically implemented in APIs (e.g., REST endpoints like `POST /tasks`, `GET /tasks`, `PUT /tasks/{id}`, `DELETE /tasks/{id}`).
- **Purpose**: Provides a standardized way to manage data, ensuring applications can store, retrieve, modify, and remove records efficiently.

In a TODO service, CRUD enables users to create tasks, view them, update their details, and delete them as needed.

### What is a query?

A **query** in a database is a request for data or instructions to retrieve, manipulate, or manage information stored in a database, typically written in a query language like SQL for relational databases. It specifies what data to access or how to modify it based on defined criteria.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Queries allow users or applications to interact with a database to perform operations like retrieving, inserting, updating, or deleting data (aligned with CRUD operations).
- **Types** (in SQL):
  - **SELECT**: Retrieves data (e.g., `SELECT title, status FROM tasks WHERE status = 'pending'`).
  - **INSERT**: Adds new data (e.g., `INSERT INTO tasks (title) VALUES ('New Task')`).
  - **UPDATE**: Modifies data (e.g., `UPDATE tasks SET status = 'completed' WHERE task_id = 1`).
  - **DELETE**: Removes data (e.g., `DELETE FROM tasks WHERE task_id = 1`).
- **Components**: Queries often include clauses like `WHERE` (filtering), `ORDER BY` (sorting), `JOIN` (combining tables), and `GROUP BY` (aggregating data).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, a query like `SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE due_date = '2025-10-01'` retrieves all tasks due on a specific date.

In backend development, queries are used to fetch or manipulate data in response to API requests or application logic, enabling dynamic interaction with the database.

### What is normalization?

**Normalization** is the process of organizing data in a relational database to eliminate redundancy, improve data integrity, and ensure efficient storage and retrieval. It involves structuring tables and their relationships according to a set of rules, called normal forms, to minimize data anomalies during CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Reduces data duplication, ensures consistency, and simplifies maintenance.
- **Normal Forms** (simplified):
  - **1NF (First Normal Form)**: Ensures all columns contain atomic (indivisible) values and each record is unique (no duplicate rows).
  - **2NF**: Meets 1NF and ensures non-key columns are fully dependent on the primary key (eliminates partial dependencies).
  - **3NF**: Meets 2NF and ensures non-key columns are not dependent on other non-key columns (eliminates transitive dependencies).
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - Unnormalized table: A `tasks` table with columns `task_id`, `title`, `user_name`, `user_email` might repeat `user_name` and `user_email` for tasks by the same user.
  - Normalized:
    - `tasks` table: `task_id`, `title`, `user_id` (foreign key).
    - `users` table: `user_id`, `user_name`, `user_email`.
    - This splits user data into a separate table, reducing redundancy.
- **Benefits**: Saves storage space, ensures data consistency, and simplifies updates.
- **Trade-offs**: May increase query complexity (e.g., requiring joins) and impact performance for read-heavy applications.

In backend development, normalization is critical for designing efficient and maintainable database schemas, especially for applications like a TODO service where tasks and user data need clear relationships.

## Networking

### What is TCP?

**TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) is a standard communication protocol used in computer networks to ensure reliable, ordered, and error-checked data transmission between devices over the internet or other networks. It operates at the transport layer of the OSI model and is a core component of the internet protocol suite (TCP/IP).

**Key Points**:

- **Reliability**: Guarantees delivery of data packets in the correct order without loss or duplication by using acknowledgments, retransmissions, and error detection.
- **Connection-Oriented**: Establishes a connection between sender and receiver via a three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) before data transfer and closes it afterward.
- **Flow Control**: Manages data flow to prevent overwhelming the receiver using mechanisms like sliding windows.
- **Error Handling**: Detects and corrects errors through checksums and retransmits lost packets.
- **Use Cases**: Used in applications requiring reliable data transfer, such as web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP), and file transfers (FTP).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, when a client sends a `POST` request to `https://api.todo-service.com/v1/tasks` to create a task, TCP ensures the request and response data are delivered accurately and in sequence.

In backend development, TCP underpins reliable communication between clients and servers, ensuring API requests and responses are transmitted correctly.

### What is UDP?

**UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) is a lightweight communication protocol used in computer networks for transmitting data between devices. It operates at the transport layer of the OSI model, like TCP, but is designed for speed and efficiency rather than reliability.

**Key Points**:

- **Connectionless**: Does not establish a connection before sending data, unlike TCP's three-way handshake.
- **Unreliable**: Does not guarantee delivery, order, or error correction; packets may be lost, duplicated, or arrive out of sequence.
- **Low Overhead**: Minimal header size and no retransmission or flow control, making it faster than TCP.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for applications where speed is critical and occasional data loss is acceptable, such as:
  - Real-time applications (e.g., video streaming, online gaming).
  - DNS queries.
  - VoIP (e.g., Zoom or Skype calls).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, UDP might be used for a real-time feature like broadcasting task updates to multiple clients, where low latency is prioritized over guaranteed delivery.

In backend development, UDP is used when performance is more critical than reliability, unlike TCP, which ensures accurate data transfer.

### What is IP?

**IP** (Internet Protocol) is a fundamental protocol in the internet protocol suite that enables communication between devices across networks, such as the internet or local networks. It operates at the network layer of the OSI model and is responsible for addressing and routing data packets from a source to a destination.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Defines how data packets are formatted, addressed, transmitted, and routed across networks.
- **Addressing**: Assigns unique IP addresses to devices to identify them (e.g., `192.168.1.1` for IPv4 or `2001:db8::1` for IPv6).
- **Versions**:
  - **IPv4**: Uses 32-bit addresses (e.g., `192.168.0.1`), limited to ~4.3 billion unique addresses.
  - **IPv6**: Uses 128-bit addresses (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`), designed to handle more devices.
- **Functions**:
  - **Packet Routing**: Directs packets through routers to reach the destination IP address.
  - **Fragmentation**: Breaks data into smaller packets for transmission and reassembles them if needed.
- **Connectionless**: Sends packets independently without establishing a connection (unlike TCP).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, when a client sends a request to `https://api.todo-service.com/v1/tasks`, the IP protocol routes the request to the server’s IP address (e.g., `93.184.216.34`).

In backend development, IP ensures data packets reach the correct server or client, forming the foundation for protocols like TCP and UDP to handle reliable or fast communication.

### What is a port?

A **port** is a virtual point in a computer’s networking system used to identify specific processes or services on a device, allowing multiple applications to communicate over a network simultaneously. It is a 16-bit number (0 to 65535) associated with an IP address to direct data to the correct application or service.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Differentiates between different services or applications running on the same device, enabling targeted data delivery.
- **Types**:
  - **Well-Known Ports** (0–1023): Reserved for common services (e.g., port 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, 22 for SSH).
  - **Registered Ports** (1024–49151): Used for specific applications or services.
  - **Dynamic/Private Ports** (49152–65535): Temporarily assigned for client-side connections.
- **How It Works**: Combines with an IP address to form a complete network address (e.g., `192.168.1.1:80` specifies HTTP traffic to a server at that IP).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, a client sending a request to `https://api.todo-service.com:443/v1/tasks` uses port 443 (HTTPS) to communicate with the server’s web service, while the server might use port 3306 internally for MySQL database connections.

In backend development, ports are critical for routing network traffic to the appropriate application or service, ensuring proper communication between clients and servers.

### What is DNS?

**DNS** (Domain Name System) is a protocol and distributed system that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `api.todo-service.com`) into machine-readable IP addresses (e.g., `93.184.216.34`) to locate devices or services on a network, such as the internet.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Acts like a phonebook for the internet, mapping domain names to IP addresses so clients can access servers without needing to know their numeric addresses.
- **How It Works**:
  - A client (e.g., a browser) sends a DNS query to a DNS resolver.
  - The resolver contacts DNS servers (e.g., root, TLD, and authoritative servers) to find the corresponding IP address.
  - The IP address is returned, allowing the client to connect to the server.
- **Components**:
  - **Domain Name**: Hierarchical name (e.g., `subdomain.example.com`).
  - **DNS Resolver**: A server that processes DNS queries.
  - **DNS Records**: Data types like A (IPv4 address), AAAA (IPv6), CNAME (alias), or MX (mail server).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, when a client accesses `https://api.todo-service.com/v1/tasks`, DNS resolves `api.todo-service.com` to an IP address like `192.168.1.1` to locate the server.
- **Port Usage**: DNS typically uses port 53 for queries (often over UDP for speed, sometimes TCP for larger responses).

In backend development, DNS is critical for enabling clients to find and connect to servers hosting APIs or web services using domain names.

### What is a socket?

A **socket** is an endpoint for communication between two devices (e.g., a client and a server) over a network. It is a software interface that enables data exchange using protocols like TCP or UDP, combining an IP address and a port number to identify a specific process or service on a device.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Facilitates bidirectional communication, allowing applications to send and receive data across networks (e.g., the internet).
- **Components**: A socket is defined by:
  - **IP Address**: Identifies the device (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
  - **Port Number**: Identifies the specific application or service (e.g., `443` for HTTPS).
  - **Protocol**: TCP (reliable, connection-oriented) or UDP (fast, connectionless).
- **Types**:
  - **Stream Sockets**: Use TCP for reliable, ordered data transfer (e.g., HTTP requests).
  - **Datagram Sockets**: Use UDP for faster, unreliable data transfer (e.g., streaming).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, when a client sends a request to `https://api.todo-service.com:443/v1/tasks`, a socket is created on the client (e.g., `192.168.1.100:49152`) and server (e.g., `93.184.216.34:443`) to handle the HTTP communication over TCP.
- **Backend Role**: Servers listen on sockets (e.g., port 80 or 443) to accept incoming client connections, while clients create sockets to initiate requests.

In backend development, sockets are fundamental for enabling network communication, such as handling API requests or real-time data exchange (e.g., WebSockets for live updates).

### What is latency?

**Latency** is the time delay between a client's request and the server's response in a network or system. It measures how long it takes for data to travel from one point to another or for a system to process a request.

**Key Points**:

- **Definition**: The duration (usually in milliseconds) from initiating an action (e.g., sending an HTTP request) to receiving the first response.
- **Causes**:
  - Network delays (e.g., distance, routing, or congestion).
  - Server processing time (e.g., database queries, computation).
  - Application inefficiencies (e.g., unoptimized code).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, if a client sends a `GET /tasks` request to `https://api.todo-service.com`, latency is the time from sending the request to receiving the first byte of the response (e.g., 50ms for a fast server, 500ms for a distant or slow one).
- **Impact**: High latency can degrade user experience, especially in real-time applications like video calls or interactive APIs.
- **Measurement**: Often measured as round-trip time (RTT) in networking or response time in APIs.

In backend development, minimizing latency is critical for performance, achieved through optimizations like caching, efficient database queries, or using content delivery networks (CDNs).

### What is bandwidth?

**Bandwidth** is the maximum rate at which data can be transferred over a network connection, typically measured in bits per second (bps), such as Mbps (megabits per second) or Gbps (gigabits per second). It represents the capacity of a network link to handle data traffic.

**Key Points**:

- **Definition**: The volume of data that can be transmitted in a given time, akin to the width of a pipe for data flow.
- **Factors Affecting Bandwidth**:
  - Network infrastructure (e.g., fiber vs. copper cables).
  - Network congestion or shared usage.
  - Hardware limitations (e.g., routers, network cards).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, if a server has a bandwidth of 100 Mbps, it can theoretically handle 100 megabits of data per second for API requests and responses (e.g., sending large lists of tasks or media files).
- **Difference from Latency**: Bandwidth is about capacity (how much data), while latency is about speed (how fast data travels).
- **Impact**: Low bandwidth can lead to slow data transfers, especially for large payloads, affecting user experience in high-traffic applications.

In backend development, bandwidth is critical for ensuring servers can handle multiple client requests efficiently, especially for data-intensive operations like streaming or bulk API responses.

### What is a firewall?

A **firewall** is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks (e.g., the internet) to protect systems from unauthorized access and threats.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Filters traffic to prevent malicious activities, such as hacking, malware, or unauthorized data access.
- **How It Works**: Examines packets (data units) and allows, blocks, or redirects them based on rules (e.g., IP addresses, ports, protocols).
- **Types**:
  - **Hardware Firewall**: Physical device between networks (e.g., a router with firewall capabilities).
  - **Software Firewall**: Runs on a server or device (e.g., Windows Defender Firewall).
  - **Network-Based**: Protects entire networks (e.g., enterprise firewalls).
  - **Host-Based**: Protects individual devices.
- **Rules Examples**:
  - Allow `HTTPS` traffic on port 443.
  - Block incoming traffic from a specific IP address.
- **Example**: In a TODO service, a firewall might allow `GET /tasks` requests to `https://api.todo-service.com:443` only from trusted IP ranges and block suspicious traffic to prevent attacks like DDoS.
- **Advanced Features**: Can include intrusion detection, VPN support, or deep packet inspection.

In backend development, firewalls are critical for securing servers hosting APIs or databases, ensuring only legitimate traffic reaches the application.

### What is NAT?

**NAT** (Network Address Translation) is a technique used in networking to map one IP address space to another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit. It is typically implemented in routers or firewalls to manage IP address allocation and enable communication between networks, especially when private IP addresses are used.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Allows multiple devices on a private network (e.g., home or office) to share a single public IP address for accessing external networks (e.g., the internet).
- **How It Works**:
  - Translates private IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.10`) to a public IP address (e.g., `203.0.113.1`) for outgoing traffic.
  - Maintains a translation table to route responses back to the correct private IP and port.
- **Types**:
  - **Static NAT**: Maps a private IP to a specific public IP (one-to-one).
  - **Dynamic NAT**: Maps private IPs to a pool of public IPs (temporary assignments).
  - **PAT (Port Address Translation)**: Maps multiple private IPs to a single public IP using different port numbers (most common, also called NAT overload).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, a server behind a NAT-enabled router with a private IP (`192.168.1.100`) sends API responses to clients on the internet via a public IP (`93.184.216.34`). The router uses NAT to translate the private IP to the public IP and tracks the connection using ports.
- **Benefits**:
  - Conserves public IP addresses.
  - Provides a layer of security by hiding internal network structures.
- **Drawbacks**: Can complicate direct inbound connections (e.g., peer-to-peer apps) unless configured with port forwarding.

In backend development, NAT is critical for managing server connectivity in private networks, enabling APIs or services to communicate with external clients while maintaining security and efficient IP usage.

## Security

### What is authentication?

**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system attempting to access a resource or application. It ensures that the entity making a request is who or what it claims to be.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Confirms identity to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources (e.g., APIs, databases).
- **Common Methods**:
  - **Password-Based**: User provides a username and password (e.g., logging into a TODO service).
  - **Token-Based**: Uses tokens like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or API keys for programmatic access.
  - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Combines multiple credentials (e.g., password + SMS code).
  - **OAuth**: Delegates authentication to a third-party provider (e.g., "Login with Google").
  - **Biometrics**: Uses fingerprints or facial recognition.
- **Example**: In a TODO service, when a user logs in with an email and password to access `https://api.todo-service.com/v1/tasks`, the backend verifies the credentials against a stored user database before granting access.
- **Outcome**: Successful authentication typically results in a session, token, or access grant, allowing the user to interact with protected resources.

In backend development, authentication is critical for securing APIs and ensuring only authorized users can perform actions like creating or viewing tasks.

### What is authorization?

**Authorization** is the process of determining whether an authenticated user, device, or system has permission to access specific resources or perform certain actions within an application or system. It occurs after authentication and focuses on what the entity is allowed to do.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Enforces access control to ensure users or systems only interact with resources or operations they are permitted to access.
- **How It Works**: The system checks the authenticated entity's permissions or roles against predefined rules or policies.
- **Common Methods**:
  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Permissions are assigned based on roles (e.g., admin, user).
  - **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Permissions are based on attributes (e.g., user location, department).
  - **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Define specific permissions for individual users or groups.
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - After authentication, a user might be authorized to view their own tasks (`GET /v1/tasks`) but not another user’s tasks.
  - An admin might be authorized to delete any task (`DELETE /v1/tasks/{id}`), while a regular user cannot.
- **Difference from Authentication**:
  - Authentication verifies _who_ you are (e.g., valid login credentials).
  - Authorization determines _what_ you can do (e.g., read or modify specific data).

In backend development, authorization is critical for securing APIs and ensuring users or clients only access resources or perform actions within their permitted scope, protecting data integrity and privacy.

### What is encryption?

**Encryption** is the process of converting readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using an algorithm and a key to protect its confidentiality. It ensures that only authorized parties with the correct key can decrypt and access the original data.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Secures sensitive data during storage or transmission to prevent unauthorized access, interception, or tampering.
- **Types**:
  - **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption (e.g., AES). Fast but requires secure key sharing.
  - **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a pair of keys (public and private) for encryption and decryption (e.g., RSA). Slower but secure for key exchange.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Protecting data in transit (e.g., HTTPS for API requests in a TODO service).
  - Securing stored data (e.g., encrypting user passwords in a database).
  - Ensuring secure communication (e.g., SSL/TLS for web servers).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, when a client sends a `POST /v1/tasks` request over HTTPS, the data (e.g., task details) is encrypted using TLS to prevent eavesdropping during transmission.
- **Components**:
  - **Plaintext**: Original data (e.g., "Create new task").
  - **Ciphertext**: Encrypted data (e.g., "X7aP9qZ...").
  - **Key**: Secret used to encrypt/decrypt (e.g., a 256-bit AES key).
  - **Algorithm**: Mathematical process (e.g., AES, RSA).

In backend development, encryption is critical for securing sensitive data, such as user credentials or API payloads, ensuring privacy and compliance with security standards.

### What is HTTPS?

**HTTPS** (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP that uses encryption to secure communication between a client (e.g., a web browser or app) and a server over a network, typically the internet. It ensures data privacy, integrity, and authentication.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Protects data in transit from eavesdropping, tampering, or interception by encrypting it with protocols like TLS (Transport Layer Security) or its predecessor, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).
- **How It Works**:
  - Uses **TLS/SSL** to encrypt HTTP requests and responses.
  - Authenticates the server using digital certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
  - Establishes a secure connection via a handshake process, ensuring only the client and server can read the data.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Encryption**: Scrambles data (e.g., API payloads) to prevent unauthorized access.
  - **Data Integrity**: Ensures data isn’t altered during transmission.
  - **Server Authentication**: Verifies the server’s identity (e.g., confirms `api.todo-service.com` is legitimate).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, a client sending a `POST /v1/tasks` request to `https://api.todo-service.com` uses HTTPS (port 443) to encrypt task data, ensuring it’s secure from interception.
- **Difference from HTTP**: HTTP is unencrypted and vulnerable to attacks like man-in-the-middle; HTTPS adds a secure layer.
- **Indicator**: Websites using HTTPS show a padlock icon in browsers and start with `https://`.

In backend development, HTTPS is essential for securing API endpoints, protecting user data (e.g., login credentials, task details), and ensuring trust in web applications.

### What is a password hash?

A **password hash** is a one-way transformation of a password into a fixed-length string of characters using a cryptographic hash function. It is used to securely store passwords in a database, making it difficult for attackers to retrieve the original password even if the database is compromised.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Protects passwords by storing them in an irreversible, encrypted form instead of plaintext.
- **How It Works**:
  - A hash function (e.g., bcrypt, SHA-256, Argon2) processes the password to produce a unique hash.
  - The hash is stored in the database instead of the actual password.
  - During login, the provided password is hashed and compared to the stored hash to verify authenticity.
- **Key Features**:
  - **One-Way**: Cannot be reversed to retrieve the original password.
  - **Deterministic**: The same password always produces the same hash (for verification).
  - **Collision-Resistant**: Different passwords should produce different hashes.
- **Salting**: A random string (salt) is added to the password before hashing to prevent attacks using precomputed tables (e.g., rainbow tables).
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - User password: `"MySecurePass123"`
  - Salt: `randomSalt123`
  - Hashed result (using bcrypt): `$2b$10$randomSalt123...hashedValue`
  - Stored in the `users` table for authentication during login.
- **Common Hash Functions**:
  - **bcrypt**: Adaptive, slow by design to resist brute-force attacks.
  - **Argon2**: Memory-hard, resistant to GPU-based attacks.
  - **SHA-256**: Faster but less secure for passwords without proper salting.

In backend development, password hashing is critical for securely storing user credentials, ensuring that even if a database is breached, the original passwords remain protected.

### What is SQL injection?

**SQL injection** is a security vulnerability in which an attacker manipulates a web application's database query by injecting malicious SQL code into user inputs (e.g., forms, URL parameters, or API payloads). This can allow unauthorized access to or manipulation of the database.

**Key Points**:

- **How It Works**: Attackers exploit poorly sanitized input fields to inject SQL commands that the database executes, altering the intended query behavior.
- **Impact**:
  - Unauthorized data access (e.g., retrieving all user data).
  - Data modification or deletion (e.g., changing or deleting tasks).
  - Bypassing authentication (e.g., logging in without valid credentials).
  - Potential database compromise or data leaks.
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - Normal query: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'john' AND password = 'pass123'`
  - Vulnerable input: User enters `' OR '1'='1` as the password.
  - Resulting query: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'john' AND password = '' OR '1'='1'`
  - This evaluates to true for all users, bypassing authentication.
- **Prevention**:
  - **Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries**: Use placeholders for user inputs (e.g., `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?`).
  - **Input Validation/Sanitization**: Restrict and clean user inputs to prevent malicious code.
  - **ORMs**: Use Object-Relational Mappers (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Sequelize) that handle inputs safely.
  - **Least Privilege**: Limit database user permissions to minimize damage.

In backend development, protecting against SQL injection is critical to secure database interactions in applications like a TODO service, ensuring user data and system integrity are maintained.

### What is XSS?

**XSS** (Cross-Site Scripting) is a security vulnerability in web applications where an attacker injects malicious scripts (typically JavaScript) into content that is then displayed to users. These scripts execute in the context of a victim’s browser, potentially compromising user data or interactions.

**Key Points**:

- **How It Works**: Attackers exploit unvalidated or unsanitized user inputs (e.g., form fields, URL parameters) to inject scripts that run when other users view the affected page or API response.
- **Types**:
  - **Stored XSS**: Malicious script is stored in the database and executed when users access the data (e.g., a comment with `<script>alert('hacked')</script>`).
  - **Reflected XSS**: Script is embedded in a URL or input and executed immediately when a user visits the manipulated link.
  - **DOM-Based XSS**: Script manipulates the browser’s Document Object Model (DOM) without server interaction.
- **Impact**:
  - Steal user data (e.g., cookies, session tokens).
  - Redirect users to malicious sites.
  - Deface websites or perform unauthorized actions (e.g., creating tasks in a TODO service).
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - An attacker submits a task title: `<script>stealCookies()</script>`.
  - If the title is displayed without sanitization, the script runs in users’ browsers when they view the task list.
- **Prevention**:
  - **Input Sanitization**: Escape or sanitize user inputs (e.g., convert `<` to `&lt;`).
  - **Output Encoding**: Encode data before rendering (e.g., use libraries like DOMPurify).
  - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Restrict script sources in browsers.
  - **Use Frameworks**: Modern frameworks (e.g., React, Angular) often escape outputs by default.
  - **Avoid eval()**: Never execute user input as code.

In backend development, preventing XSS is critical to protect users interacting with APIs or web interfaces, ensuring malicious scripts don’t compromise the application or user data in systems like a TODO service.

### What is CSRF?

**CSRF** (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a security vulnerability in web applications where an attacker tricks an authenticated user into performing unintended actions on a trusted site without their knowledge or consent. It exploits the trust a website has in a user’s browser, which may automatically include credentials (e.g., cookies) with requests.

**Key Points**:

- **How It Works**: An attacker crafts a malicious request (e.g., via a link, image, or form) that, when triggered by a logged-in user, sends a request to the target site, leveraging the user’s active session to execute unauthorized actions.
- **Impact**:
  - Perform actions like changing account details, creating/deleting resources, or transferring funds.
  - Compromise user data or application integrity.
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - A user is logged into `https://api.todo-service.com`.
  - They visit a malicious site that includes an image tag: `<img src="https://api.todo-service.com/v1/tasks/delete/123">`.
  - The browser sends a `GET` request to delete task `123`, using the user’s session cookie, without their knowledge.
- **Prevention**:
  - **CSRF Tokens**: Include a unique, unpredictable token in legitimate requests (e.g., in forms or headers) that the server validates.
  - **SameSite Cookies**: Set cookies with `SameSite=Strict` or `SameSite=Lax` to restrict cross-site requests.
  - **Validate HTTP Methods**: Use POST instead of GET for state-changing actions and verify methods server-side.
  - **User Interaction**: Require explicit confirmation for sensitive actions (e.g., re-entering a password).
  - **CORS Policies**: Restrict cross-origin requests to trusted domains.

In backend development, preventing CSRF is crucial for securing APIs and web applications, ensuring that actions like creating or deleting tasks in a TODO service are performed only by authorized, intentional user requests.

### What is a session?

A **session** is a temporary, server-managed interaction between a client (e.g., a user's browser or app) and a server that maintains state information across multiple requests during a user's visit to a web application. It is used to track user activity, maintain login status, or store temporary data without requiring repeated authentication.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Preserves user-specific data (e.g., login status, preferences) across stateless HTTP requests.
- **How It Works**:
  - When a user logs in or starts interacting, the server creates a session and assigns a unique **session ID**.
  - The session ID is typically stored in a cookie or sent in requests (e.g., via headers).
  - The server stores session data (e.g., user ID, role) in memory, a database, or a cache (e.g., Redis).
  - The client includes the session ID in subsequent requests, allowing the server to retrieve the associated session data.
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - A user logs into `https://api.todo-service.com` with credentials.
  - The server creates a session, stores it (e.g., `session_id: abc123, user_id: 456`), and sends `abc123` to the client in a cookie.
  - When the user requests `GET /v1/tasks`, the browser sends the session ID, and the server verifies the user’s identity to return their tasks.
- **Features**:
  - **Expiration**: Sessions typically expire after a set time (e.g., 30 minutes) or on logout for security.
  - **Security**: Can be secured with HTTPS, secure cookies, and session tokens to prevent hijacking.
- **Session Storage**:
  - **Server-Side**: Session data stored on the server (e.g., in Redis, database).
  - **Client-Side**: Minimal data (session ID) stored in cookies or tokens (e.g., JWT for stateless sessions).
- **Use Case**: Maintains user authentication state, so a logged-in user can access protected endpoints like `POST /v1/tasks` without re-entering credentials.

In backend development, sessions are critical for managing user interactions in applications like a TODO service, ensuring a seamless and secure experience while maintaining state across requests.

### What is a cookie?

A **cookie** is a small piece of data stored by a web server on a client’s device (e.g., browser) and sent back to the server with subsequent requests. It is used to maintain state, track user activity, or store small amounts of information across HTTP requests, which are inherently stateless.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Enables persistence of user-specific data, such as session IDs, preferences, or tracking information, between requests.
- **How It Works**:
  - The server sends a cookie to the client via an HTTP response header (`Set-Cookie`).
  - The client (e.g., browser) stores the cookie and includes it in future requests to the same server via the `Cookie` header.
- **Components**:
  - **Name-Value Pair**: The key and data (e.g., `session_id=abc123`).
  - **Attributes**: Optional settings like:
    - `Expires` or `Max-Age`: When the cookie expires.
    - `Domain`: Which domains can access the cookie (e.g., `todo-service.com`).
    - `Path`: Which paths on the server the cookie applies to (e.g., `/v1`).
    - `Secure`: Ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS.
    - `HttpOnly`: Prevents client-side scripts from accessing the cookie (mitigates XSS).
    - `SameSite`: Controls cross-site request behavior (e.g., `Strict`, `Lax`, `None`).
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - After a user logs into `https://api.todo-service.com`, the server sends a cookie: `Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict`.
  - The browser stores it and includes `Cookie: session_id=abc123` in subsequent requests (e.g., `GET /v1/tasks`), allowing the server to identify the user.
- **Types**:
  - **Session Cookies**: Temporary, deleted when the browser closes.
  - **Persistent Cookies**: Stored until they expire or are deleted.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Maintaining user sessions (e.g., staying logged in).
  - Storing user preferences (e.g., theme settings).
  - Tracking user behavior (e.g., analytics).

In backend development, cookies are critical for managing sessions and user state in applications like a TODO service, but they must be secured (e.g., with `Secure` and `HttpOnly`) to prevent attacks like XSS or session hijacking.

## Performance

### What is caching?

**Caching** is the process of storing frequently accessed data or computed results in a temporary, fast-access storage layer (cache) to reduce latency, decrease server load, and improve performance in a system or application. Instead of repeatedly fetching or computing data from a slower source (e.g., database, disk, or network), the cache provides quick access to the stored copy.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Speeds up data retrieval, reduces resource usage, and enhances user experience.
- **How It Works**:
  - Data is stored in a cache (e.g., memory, Redis, or browser) after its first retrieval or computation.
  - Subsequent requests check the cache first; if the data is found (cache hit), it’s returned quickly; if not (cache miss), the data is fetched from the source and stored in the cache.
- **Types**:
  - **In-Memory Cache**: Stores data in RAM (e.g., Redis, Memcached) for fast access.
  - **Database Cache**: Stores query results to avoid redundant database queries.
  - **Client-Side Cache**: Stores data in the browser (e.g., HTTP caching with cookies or local storage).
  - **Distributed Cache**: Shared cache across multiple servers (e.g., in microservices).
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - A `GET /v1/tasks` request fetches a user’s task list from the database and stores it in a Redis cache with a key like `user:123:tasks`.
  - Future requests for the same user’s tasks check Redis first, avoiding a database query unless the cache expires or is invalidated.
- **Cache Management**:
  - **Expiration**: Data is removed after a set time (TTL, time-to-live) to ensure freshness.
  - **Invalidation**: Cache is updated or cleared when data changes (e.g., a task is updated).
  - **Eviction Policies**: Remove old data (e.g., LRU - Least Recently Used) when the cache is full.
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces latency (faster responses).
  - Lowers database or server load.
  - Improves scalability for high-traffic applications.
- **Challenges**:
  - Cache staleness (outdated data).
  - Memory usage (caches can consume significant resources).
  - Consistency management (ensuring cache aligns with source data).

In backend development, caching is critical for optimizing API performance in applications like a TODO service, especially for frequently accessed data like task lists or user profiles.

### What is load time?

**Load time** is the duration it takes for a system, application, or resource (e.g., a webpage, API response, or database query) to fully process a request and deliver the requested data to the client. In the context of backend development, it typically refers to the time taken for a server to handle a request, including processing, querying databases, and returning a response.

**Key Points**:

- **Definition**: The total time from when a client sends a request (e.g., clicking a link or calling an API) to when the response is fully received and usable.
- **Components**:
  - **Network Latency**: Time for data to travel between client and server.
  - **Server Processing**: Time to execute backend logic, query databases, or fetch cached data.
  - **Data Transfer**: Time to send the response back to the client.
- **Example**: In a TODO service, the load time for a `GET /v1/tasks` request might include:
  - 50ms for network round-trip.
  - 100ms for the server to query the database and process the request.
  - 20ms to transfer the response (e.g., a JSON list of tasks).
  - Total load time: ~170ms.
- **Importance**: Affects user experience; faster load times improve responsiveness and satisfaction.
- **Optimization Techniques**:
  - Use caching (e.g., Redis) to reduce database query time.
  - Optimize database queries (e.g., indexing, avoiding unnecessary joins).
  - Implement content delivery networks (CDNs) for static assets.
  - Minimize payload size (e.g., compress JSON responses).

**Load Time** vs. **Latency**:

- **Scope**:
  - **Latency**: Measures the initial delay (time to first byte).
  - **Load Time**: Measures the entire process (request to complete response).
- **Focus**:
  - **Latency**: Focuses on network and initial server response speed.
  - **Load Time**: Includes latency plus server processing and data transfer.
- **Impact**:
  - High latency delays the start of a response, affecting perceived responsiveness.
  - High load time affects the overall user experience, especially for large responses.

In backend development, minimizing load time is critical for ensuring efficient API performance and a smooth user experience in applications like a TODO service.

### What is throughput?

**Throughput** is the rate at which a system processes or completes tasks, requests, or data transfers over a given period, typically measured in units like requests per second, transactions per second, or bytes per second. In backend development, it indicates the system’s capacity to handle workload efficiently.

**Key Points**:

- **Definition**: The number of operations or amount of data processed within a specific time frame.
- **Purpose**: Measures system performance and scalability under load, showing how many requests or tasks a server can handle.
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - If the server processes 100 `GET /v1/tasks` requests per second, the throughput is 100 requests/second.
  - For data transfer, if it sends 10 MB of task data per second, the throughput is 10 MB/s.
- **Factors Affecting Throughput**:
  - Server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
  - Network bandwidth and latency.
  - Database performance (e.g., query efficiency).
  - Application optimization (e.g., caching, load balancing).
- **Difference from Latency**:
  - **Latency**: Time for a single request to get a response (e.g., 50ms for one `GET /v1/tasks`).
  - **Throughput**: Number of requests handled in a time period (e.g., 100 requests/second).
- **Importance**: High throughput indicates a system can handle many users or requests, critical for scalability in high-traffic applications.

In backend development, optimizing throughput (e.g., via caching, efficient queries, or load balancing) is key to ensuring a TODO service API can handle multiple users accessing tasks simultaneously without performance degradation.

### What is response time?

**Response time** is the total duration it takes for a system to process a request and return a complete response to the client. It measures the end-to-end time from when a client initiates a request (e.g., clicking a link or sending an API call) to when the client receives the full response, ready for use or rendering.

**Key Points**:

- **Definition**: The time elapsed from sending a request to receiving and processing the entire response.
- **Components**:
  - **Network Latency**: Time for the request to travel to the server and the response to return.
  - **Server Processing Time**: Time for the server to execute logic, query databases, or fetch data.
  - **Data Transfer Time**: Time to send the response data back to the client.
  - **Client-Side Processing** (optional): Time to render or process the response (e.g., in a browser).
- **Example**: In a TODO service, for a `GET /v1/tasks` request:
  - Network latency: 50ms (round-trip time).
  - Server processing: 100ms (database query and logic).
  - Data transfer: 20ms (sending JSON response).
  - Total response time: ~170ms.
- **Difference from Related Terms**:
  - **Latency**: Time to receive the first byte of the response (e.g., 50ms in the example above).
  - **Load Time**: Often synonymous with response time in backend contexts, but may include client-side rendering for web pages.
  - **Throughput**: Number of requests handled per unit time (e.g., 100 requests/second), not the time for a single request.
- **Importance**: Low response time improves user experience and application performance, especially for interactive systems like APIs.
- **Optimization**: Use caching (e.g., Redis), optimize database queries, reduce payload size, or leverage CDNs to lower response time.

In backend development, minimizing response time is critical for ensuring fast and efficient API interactions, such as retrieving task lists in a TODO service, enhancing user satisfaction and system scalability.

### What is scalability?

**Scalability** is the ability of a system, application, or infrastructure to handle increasing amounts of work (e.g., more users, requests, or data) or to be expanded to accommodate that growth without compromising performance or reliability.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Ensures a system can grow to meet rising demand while maintaining efficiency and user experience.
- **Types**:
  - **Vertical Scalability (Scaling Up)**: Adding more resources (e.g., CPU, RAM) to a single server to handle more load.
  - **Horizontal Scalability (Scaling Out)**: Adding more servers or instances to distribute the load across multiple machines.
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - **Vertical**: Upgrading the server’s CPU or memory to handle more `GET /v1/tasks` requests.
  - **Horizontal**: Adding more servers behind a load balancer to distribute API requests across multiple instances.
- **Factors Affecting Scalability**:
  - Architecture design (e.g., microservices vs. monolithic).
  - Efficient use of resources (e.g., caching, optimized queries).
  - Load balancing and distributed systems.
  - Database performance (e.g., sharding, replication).
- **Importance**: Critical for handling traffic spikes, user growth, or large datasets without slowdowns or downtime.
- **Challenges**: Increased complexity, cost, and potential for issues like data consistency in distributed systems.

In backend development, scalability ensures a TODO service API can support thousands of users accessing tasks concurrently, using techniques like load balancing, caching, or database sharding to maintain performance.

### What is vertical scaling?

**Vertical scaling**, also known as _scaling up_, is the process of increasing the capacity of a single server or system by adding more resources, such as CPU, RAM, storage, or network bandwidth, to handle increased workload or improve performance.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Enhances the ability of a single machine to process more requests, data, or computations without changing the system architecture.
- **How It Works**: Upgrade hardware or allocate more resources to the existing server (e.g., increasing from 4GB to 16GB RAM or from 2 to 8 CPU cores).
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - A server handling `GET /v1/tasks` requests struggles with 1,000 concurrent users.
  - Adding more RAM or a faster CPU to the server allows it to process more requests efficiently.
- **Advantages**:
  - Simple to implement (no architectural changes needed).
  - Minimal changes to application code or configuration.
  - Suitable for smaller-scale applications or quick performance boosts.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limited by hardware constraints (e.g., maximum CPU or RAM a server can support).
  - Expensive due to high-cost hardware upgrades.
  - Single point of failure (no redundancy if the server fails).
- **Contrast with Horizontal Scaling**: Vertical scaling adds power to one server, while horizontal scaling adds more servers to distribute the load.

In backend development, vertical scaling is a straightforward way to improve performance for applications like a TODO service API, but it’s less flexible than horizontal scaling for handling massive or unpredictable traffic growth.

### What is horizontal scaling?

**Horizontal scaling**, also known as _scaling out_, is the process of increasing a system's capacity by adding more servers or instances to distribute the workload across multiple machines, rather than upgrading a single server.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Enhances system performance and capacity by sharing the load across multiple nodes, improving scalability and reliability.
- **How It Works**: Additional servers or instances are added, and a load balancer distributes incoming requests (e.g., API calls) across them. Each server handles a portion of the workload.
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - A single server struggles with 10,000 concurrent `GET /v1/tasks` requests.
  - Adding three more servers and using a load balancer to distribute requests allows the system to handle the increased traffic efficiently.
- **Advantages**:
  - Virtually unlimited scalability (add as many servers as needed).
  - Improved fault tolerance (if one server fails, others continue to operate).
  - Cost-effective for large-scale systems (uses commodity hardware or cloud instances).
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Increased complexity (requires load balancing, distributed systems, and data consistency management).
  - May need application redesign (e.g., to handle stateless operations or distributed databases).
  - Potential for higher latency in some cases due to coordination overhead.
- **Contrast with Vertical Scaling**: Horizontal scaling adds more machines, while vertical scaling upgrades a single machine’s resources (e.g., CPU, RAM).
- **Technologies**: Often uses cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure), containerization (e.g., Docker), and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) to manage multiple instances.

In backend development, horizontal scaling is critical for handling high traffic in applications like a TODO service API, ensuring performance and availability as user demand grows, especially in distributed systems.

### What is a bottleneck?

A **bottleneck** is a point in a system where the flow of data, requests, or processes is limited, causing reduced performance, slower response times, or decreased throughput. It occurs when a component (e.g., hardware, software, or network) cannot handle the workload efficiently, restricting the overall system's capacity.

**Key Points**:

- **Definition**: A bottleneck is like a narrow section of a pipe that restricts flow, slowing down the entire system.
- **Causes**:
  - **Hardware**: Insufficient CPU, RAM, or disk I/O capacity.
  - **Database**: Slow queries, lack of indexing, or high contention.
  - **Network**: Limited bandwidth or high latency.
  - **Software**: Inefficient code, single-threaded processes, or poor resource management.
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - A database query for `GET /v1/tasks` takes 500ms due to a missing index, slowing down API responses despite a fast server. The database is the bottleneck.
  - A server with limited CPU struggles to handle 10,000 concurrent requests, causing delays.
- **Impact**:
  - Increased response times or latency.
  - Reduced throughput (fewer requests processed per second).
  - Poor user experience or system failures under load.
- **Identification**: Use monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, New Relic) to detect slow components via metrics like CPU usage, query times, or request queues.
- **Solutions**:
  - Optimize code or queries (e.g., add database indexes).
  - Scale resources (vertical or horizontal scaling).
  - Implement caching (e.g., Redis for frequent queries).
  - Use load balancing to distribute traffic.

In backend development, identifying and resolving bottlenecks is critical for maintaining performance and scalability in applications like a TODO service, ensuring efficient handling of API requests and data processing.

### What is optimization?

**Optimization** is the process of improving a system, application, or process to enhance its performance, efficiency, or resource utilization while maintaining or improving functionality. It aims to reduce latency, increase throughput, minimize resource consumption (e.g., CPU, memory, or bandwidth), or improve scalability and reliability.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: To make a system faster, more cost-effective, or capable of handling higher loads with better user experience.
- **Areas of Optimization**:
  - **Code**: Refactor inefficient algorithms or reduce complexity (e.g., from O(n²) to O(n log n)).
  - **Database**: Optimize queries (e.g., add indexes, reduce joins), use caching (e.g., Redis), or implement sharding.
  - **Network**: Minimize latency with CDNs, compress responses, or use efficient protocols (e.g., HTTP/2).
  - **Resources**: Optimize CPU, memory, or disk usage (e.g., via load balancing or vertical scaling).
  - **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling or use asynchronous processing.
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - Unoptimized: A `GET /v1/tasks` request takes 500ms due to a slow database query scanning an entire table.
  - Optimized: Adding an index to the `tasks` table reduces query time to 50ms, improving response time.
  - Caching the task list in Redis further reduces database load, boosting throughput.
- **Techniques**:
  - Caching frequently accessed data.
  - Indexing databases for faster queries.
  - Compressing data (e.g., Gzip for API responses).
  - Using asynchronous operations to handle concurrent requests.
  - Load balancing to distribute traffic across servers.
- **Trade-offs**: Optimization may increase complexity, development time, or maintenance costs (e.g., caching introduces consistency challenges).

In backend development, optimization is critical for ensuring a TODO service API delivers fast responses, handles high traffic, and uses resources efficiently, ultimately improving user satisfaction and system scalability.

### What is indexing in databases?

**Indexing** in databases is a technique used to improve the speed and efficiency of data retrieval by creating a data structure (an index) that allows the database to quickly locate and access records without scanning the entire table.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Reduces query execution time for operations like `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, or `ORDER BY` by providing a faster lookup mechanism.
- **How It Works**:
  - An index is a separate data structure (e.g., B-tree or hash table) that stores a subset of the table’s data, typically the values of one or more columns, along with pointers to the corresponding rows.
  - When a query is executed, the database uses the index to find matching rows instead of scanning the entire table.
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - Table: `tasks` with columns `task_id`, `title`, `status`, `due_date`.
  - Without an index, a query like `SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE status = 'pending'` scans all rows.
  - With an index on `status`, the database quickly locates rows where `status = 'pending'`, reducing query time (e.g., from 500ms to 50ms).
- **Types of Indexes**:
  - **Primary Index**: Automatically created for the primary key (e.g., `task_id`).
  - **Unique Index**: Ensures unique values in a column (e.g., `email` in a `users` table).
  - **Secondary Index**: Created on non-key columns to speed up queries (e.g., `due_date`).
  - **Composite Index**: Indexes multiple columns for complex queries (e.g., `status` and `due_date`).
  - **Clustered Index**: Determines the physical order of data in the table (usually one per table).
  - **Non-Clustered Index**: Separate from the table’s data, pointing to rows (can have multiple).
- **Benefits**:
  - Faster query performance (especially for large datasets).
  - Efficient filtering, sorting, and joining.
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Increased storage (indexes consume disk space).
  - Slower write operations (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) as indexes must be updated.
  - Maintenance overhead (indexes need to be rebuilt or optimized).
- **Use Case**: In a TODO service, indexing the `user_id` column in the `tasks` table speeds up queries like `SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE user_id = 123`, improving API response times for user-specific task lists.

In backend development, indexing is critical for optimizing database performance in applications like a TODO service, ensuring fast data retrieval while balancing write performance and storage costs.

## Concurrency

### What is a thread?

A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution within a process in a computer's operating system, allowing a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently. It represents a sequence of instructions that can be executed independently, sharing the same memory space and resources as other threads within the same process.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Enables concurrent execution of tasks, improving performance and responsiveness in applications.
- **How It Works**:
  - A process (e.g., a running application) can have multiple threads, each executing a specific task.
  - Threads share the process’s memory, file handles, and other resources, but each has its own stack and program counter.
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - A backend server handling `GET /v1/tasks` requests might use one thread to process incoming HTTP requests, another to query the database, and another to handle response formatting, all within the same server process.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Lightweight**: Threads are less resource-intensive than processes, as they share resources.
  - **Concurrency**: Multiple threads can run simultaneously (on multi-core CPUs) or be scheduled by the OS.
  - **Context Switching**: The OS switches between threads, which is faster than switching between processes.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Handling multiple client requests in a web server (e.g., Node.js with async threads or Java with thread pools).
  - Parallel processing of tasks, like generating reports or processing task updates in a TODO service.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Race Conditions**: Multiple threads accessing shared data can cause inconsistencies.
  - **Deadlocks**: Threads waiting for each other to release resources can halt execution.
  - **Synchronization**: Requires mechanisms like mutexes or locks to manage shared resources safely.
- **Contrast with Process**:
  - A process is an independent program with its own memory space.
  - Threads within a process share memory and resources, making them more efficient for multitasking.

In backend development, threads are critical for building responsive and efficient systems, such as handling concurrent API requests in a TODO service, but they require careful management to avoid issues like race conditions or deadlocks.

### What is a process?

A **process** is an instance of a program that is actively running on a computer, managed by the operating system. It represents a self-contained execution environment with its own memory space, resources, and state, capable of performing tasks independently.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Executes a program’s instructions, handling tasks like computation, I/O operations, or network communication.
- **Components**:
  - **Code**: The program’s instructions (e.g., a web server application).
  - **Data**: Variables and memory allocated for the program.
  - **Stack**: Temporary storage for function calls and variables.
  - **Heap**: Dynamic memory allocation.
  - **Resources**: File handles, network sockets, and CPU time.
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - A web server (e.g., Node.js or Apache) runs as a process to handle API requests like `GET /v1/tasks`.
  - A database server (e.g., MySQL) runs as a separate process to manage queries.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Isolation**: Each process has its own memory space, preventing interference with other processes.
  - **Heavyweight**: Processes require more resources than threads due to separate memory and resource allocation.
  - **Multitasking**: The OS schedules multiple processes to run concurrently, switching between them.
- **Contrast with Thread**:
  - A **process** is an independent program with its own memory and resources.
  - A **thread** is a lightweight unit of execution within a process, sharing the process’s memory and resources.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Running a backend server (e.g., for a TODO service API).
  - Executing a database instance or a background job (e.g., task scheduler).
- **Challenges**:
  - **Resource Usage**: Processes consume more memory and CPU than threads.
  - **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: Processes need mechanisms like pipes or message queues to communicate, which can be slower than thread communication.
  - **Context Switching**: Switching between processes is slower than switching between threads.

In backend development, processes are fundamental for running applications like a TODO service’s web server or database, enabling isolated and robust execution of tasks, while threads within a process handle concurrent subtasks for efficiency.

### What is multitasking?

**Multitasking** is the ability of a computer system or operating system to execute multiple tasks or processes concurrently, allowing multiple operations to appear to run simultaneously. It enables efficient use of system resources by rapidly switching between tasks or executing them in parallel, depending on the system's capabilities.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Improves system efficiency and responsiveness by allowing multiple activities (e.g., running applications, handling requests) to share CPU time.
- **How It Works**:
  - The operating system schedules tasks (processes or threads) using techniques like time-sharing or prioritization.
  - On a single-core CPU, multitasking is achieved through **context switching**, where the CPU rapidly alternates between tasks.
  - On multi-core CPUs, true parallel execution of tasks is possible.
- **Types**:
  - **Preemptive Multitasking**: The OS controls task switching, allocating time slices to each task (used in modern OS like Windows, Linux).
  - **Cooperative Multitasking**: Tasks voluntarily yield control to others (less common, used in older systems).
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - A backend server process handles multiple `GET /v1/tasks` API requests concurrently by using threads or asynchronous tasks.
  - Simultaneously, a database process runs queries, and a background process sends reminder emails, all managed by the OS.
- **Benefits**:
  - Improved responsiveness (e.g., users can interact with a TODO app while the server processes other requests).
  - Efficient resource utilization (CPU, memory).
- **Challenges**:
  - **Overhead**: Context switching consumes CPU time.
  - **Resource Contention**: Tasks competing for resources (e.g., CPU, memory) can cause bottlenecks.
  - **Synchronization**: Requires mechanisms like locks to prevent conflicts in shared resources.
- **Contrast with Related Terms**:
  - **Multithreading**: Multiple threads within a single process share the same memory and resources.
  - **Parallelism**: Simultaneous execution of tasks on multiple CPU cores.

In backend development, multitasking is critical for handling concurrent API requests, database operations, and background jobs in applications like a TODO service, ensuring the system remains responsive under load.

### What is parallelism?

**Parallelism** is the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks or processes on multiple processing units (e.g., CPU cores, processors, or machines) to improve performance and reduce processing time. Unlike multitasking, which may involve rapid switching between tasks on a single processor, parallelism involves true concurrent execution.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Increases efficiency by dividing a workload across multiple resources to process tasks at the same time, reducing overall execution time.
- **How It Works**:
  - Tasks are split into smaller, independent subtasks that can run concurrently on separate CPU cores, threads, or servers.
  - Requires hardware support (e.g., multi-core CPUs, GPUs, or distributed systems) and software designed to leverage parallelism.
- **Types**:
  - **Task Parallelism**: Different tasks run simultaneously (e.g., one thread handles API requests while another processes database queries).
  - **Data Parallelism**: The same operation is applied to different data chunks simultaneously (e.g., processing a large dataset across multiple cores).
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - A server with a multi-core CPU handles multiple `GET /v1/tasks` requests simultaneously, with each core processing a different request.
  - A batch job to update the status of thousands of tasks splits the workload across multiple threads or servers, each processing a subset of tasks in parallel.
- **Benefits**:
  - Faster execution for computationally intensive tasks.
  - Improved throughput for high-load systems.
  - Efficient use of multi-core or distributed systems.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Coordination Overhead**: Managing parallel tasks requires synchronization (e.g., locks, semaphores) to avoid conflicts.
  - **Complexity**: Writing parallel code is harder due to issues like race conditions or deadlocks.
  - **Resource Limits**: Dependent on available hardware (e.g., number of CPU cores).
- **Contrast with Multitasking**:
  - **Multitasking**: Tasks share a single processor via time-slicing, appearing to run concurrently.
  - **Parallelism**: Tasks run simultaneously on multiple processors or cores for true concurrency.
- **Technologies**: Supported by multi-threading (e.g., Java’s ThreadPool), task queues (e.g., Celery), or distributed frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark).

In backend development, parallelism is critical for scaling applications like a TODO service, enabling faster processing of API requests, database operations, or background jobs by leveraging multiple cores or servers.

### What is concurrency?

**Concurrency** is the ability of a system to manage multiple tasks or processes at the same time, allowing them to make progress without necessarily executing simultaneously. It focuses on handling multiple operations in an overlapping manner, often by interleaving their execution, to improve responsiveness and resource utilization.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Enables efficient handling of multiple tasks (e.g., user requests, computations) by allowing them to run in a coordinated way, even on a single processor.
- **How It Works**:
  - Tasks are executed in small chunks, with the system switching between them (e.g., via time-slicing in multitasking or asynchronous operations).
  - Concurrency does not require simultaneous execution (unlike parallelism); tasks may share a single CPU core.
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - A backend server handles multiple `GET /v1/tasks` requests concurrently by processing one request while waiting for a database query for another, using asynchronous I/O or threads.
  - A single-threaded Node.js server uses an event loop to concurrently manage API requests without blocking.
- **Types**:
  - **Thread-Based Concurrency**: Multiple threads within a process share resources and take turns executing (e.g., Java threads).
  - **Asynchronous Concurrency**: Tasks are managed using async operations (e.g., JavaScript’s `async/await` or Python’s `asyncio`), allowing non-blocking I/O.
  - **Event-Driven Concurrency**: Uses an event loop to handle tasks triggered by events (e.g., HTTP requests).
- **Benefits**:
  - Improved responsiveness (e.g., handling multiple API requests without waiting for each to complete).
  - Better resource utilization (e.g., CPU can work while waiting for I/O operations like database queries).
- **Challenges**:
  - **Race Conditions**: Multiple tasks accessing shared resources can cause inconsistencies.
  - **Deadlocks**: Tasks waiting for each other can halt progress.
  - **Complexity**: Requires synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, semaphores) to manage shared resources.
- **Contrast with Parallelism**:
  - **Concurrency**: Focuses on managing multiple tasks at once, interleaving their execution (e.g., on a single core).
  - **Parallelism**: Focuses on executing multiple tasks simultaneously on multiple cores or machines.
- **Example in Context**:
  - Concurrency: A TODO service API handles 100 simultaneous `POST /v1/tasks` requests by interleaving database writes and response preparation on a single CPU.
  - Parallelism: The same API uses multiple CPU cores to process those 100 requests simultaneously.

In backend development, concurrency is critical for building responsive and scalable systems like a TODO service, allowing efficient handling of multiple API requests or background tasks, especially in high-traffic scenarios.

### What is a mutex?

A **mutex** (short for mutual exclusion) is a synchronization mechanism used in concurrent programming to prevent multiple threads or processes from simultaneously accessing or modifying a shared resource, thereby avoiding race conditions and ensuring data consistency.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Ensures that only one thread or process can access a critical section of code or shared resource (e.g., memory, file, or database) at a time, preventing conflicts.
- **How It Works**:
  - A mutex acts like a lock: a thread must acquire the mutex before entering the critical section and release it when done.
  - If another thread tries to acquire the mutex while it’s held, it waits (blocks) until the mutex is released.
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - Multiple threads handle `POST /v1/tasks` requests to add tasks to a shared database.
  - A mutex ensures only one thread updates the `tasks` table at a time, preventing duplicate or inconsistent task IDs.
  - Code example (pseudocode):
    ```pseudo title="pseudo"
    mutex.lock()
    try {
        database.insert(new_task)
    } finally {
        mutex.unlock()
    }
    ```
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Exclusive Access**: Only one thread holds the mutex at a time.
  - **Blocking**: Threads attempting to acquire a locked mutex wait until it’s free.
  - **Scope**: Typically used within a single process, but can be extended to inter-process synchronization.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Protecting shared data structures (e.g., a counter for task IDs).
  - Synchronizing access to shared resources like files or network connections.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Deadlocks**: Occur if threads lock multiple mutexes in conflicting orders.
  - **Performance Overhead**: Locking/unlocking can slow down execution if overused.
  - **Starvation**: A thread may wait indefinitely if others keep acquiring the mutex.
- **Contrast with Other Mechanisms**:
  - **Semaphore**: Allows a fixed number of threads to access a resource (not just one like a mutex).
  - **Read-Write Lock**: Allows multiple readers or one writer, unlike a mutex’s single access.

In backend development, mutexes are critical for ensuring thread-safe operations in applications like a TODO service, especially when multiple threads handle concurrent API requests or database updates, preventing data corruption or inconsistencies.

### What is a semaphore?

A **semaphore** is a synchronization mechanism used in concurrent programming to control access to a shared resource or coordinate multiple threads or processes. It maintains a counter that regulates how many threads can access a resource simultaneously, preventing race conditions and ensuring orderly execution.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Manages access to a limited number of resources or synchronizes tasks in concurrent environments.
- **How It Works**:
  - A semaphore is initialized with a non-negative integer (the counter), representing the number of available resources or allowed concurrent accesses.
  - Threads perform two primary operations:
    - **Acquire/Wait (P)**: Decrements the counter if positive; if zero, the thread waits (blocks) until the counter is incremented.
    - **Release/Signal (V)**: Increments the counter, allowing waiting threads to proceed.
- **Types**:
  - **Binary Semaphore**: Counter is 0 or 1, functioning like a mutex (single access).
  - **Counting Semaphore**: Counter can be any non-negative integer, allowing multiple threads to access a resource pool (e.g., 5 database connections).
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - A server has a pool of 5 database connections shared by multiple threads handling `POST /v1/tasks` requests.
  - A semaphore with a count of 5 ensures only 5 threads can access a connection at a time.
  - Pseudocode:
    ```pseudo title="pseudo"
    semaphore.acquire()  // Wait if no connections available
    try {
        database.insert(new_task)
    } finally {
        semaphore.release()  // Return connection to pool
    }
    ```
- **Use Cases**:
  - Limiting concurrent access to a resource (e.g., database connections, file handles).
  - Coordinating task execution (e.g., ensuring a task processor waits for data to be ready).
- **Advantages**:
  - Flexible for controlling multiple resource accesses (unlike a mutex, which allows only one).
  - Supports resource pools and task synchronization.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Deadlocks**: Possible if semaphores are mismanaged (e.g., acquiring without releasing).
  - **Complexity**: Requires careful design to avoid starvation or priority inversion.
  - **Overhead**: Managing the counter adds slight performance cost.
- **Contrast with Mutex**:
  - **Mutex**: Locks a single resource for exclusive access by one thread.
  - **Semaphore**: Controls access to multiple resources or allows multiple threads (if counter > 1).

In backend development, semaphores are crucial for managing concurrent access to limited resources in applications like a TODO service, ensuring efficient and safe handling of API requests or database operations in high-traffic scenarios.

### What is deadlock?

A **deadlock** is a situation in concurrent programming where two or more threads or processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for a resource that another holds, creating a cycle of dependencies that prevents progress.

**Key Points**:

- **Definition**: A state where threads/processes are stuck, each holding a resource and waiting for another resource that is held by another thread/process in the group.
- **Conditions for Deadlock** (Coffman Conditions):
  - **Mutual Exclusion**: Resources involved are held in a non-shareable mode (e.g., a mutex or lock).
  - **Hold and Wait**: A thread holding a resource is waiting to acquire another resource.
  - **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a thread; they must be released voluntarily.
  - **Circular Wait**: A cycle exists where each thread waits for a resource held by the next thread.
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - Thread 1 locks the `tasks` table to update a task and waits to lock the `users` table.
  - Thread 2 locks the `users` table to update a user and waits to lock the `tasks` table.
  - Result: Thread 1 waits for Thread 2 to release `users`, and Thread 2 waits for Thread 1 to release `tasks`, causing a deadlock.
  - Pseudocode:
    ```pseudo title="pseudo"
    Thread 1:
        lock(tasks_table)
        lock(users_table)  // Waits for Thread 2
    Thread 2:
        lock(users_table)
        lock(tasks_table)  // Waits for Thread 1
    ```
- **Impact**:
  - System hangs or becomes unresponsive.
  - Degraded performance or complete failure of affected operations (e.g., API requests stall).
- **Prevention**:
  - **Avoid Circular Wait**: Enforce a consistent order for acquiring locks (e.g., always lock `tasks` before `users`).
  - **Timeouts**: Set a timeout for acquiring resources, releasing locks if the wait is too long.
  - **Resource Preemption**: Allow the system to forcibly release resources (though complex).
  - **Deadlock Detection**: Monitor for cycles and resolve them (e.g., terminate a thread).
  - **Use Higher-Level Constructs**: Use database transactions or frameworks that manage concurrency.
- **Resolution**:
  - Terminate one or more threads/processes.
  - Roll back transactions in databases.
  - Restart the affected system components.
- **Use Case**: In a TODO service, deadlocks can occur when multiple threads handle concurrent `POST /v1/tasks` and `PUT /v1/users` requests that lock shared database tables.

In backend development, preventing and detecting deadlocks is critical for ensuring reliable and responsive systems like a TODO service API, especially when handling concurrent database operations or shared resources.

### What is race condition?

A **race condition** is a situation in concurrent programming where the outcome of a program depends on the unpredictable order or timing of execution of multiple threads or processes accessing shared resources without proper synchronization. This can lead to inconsistent or incorrect results, such as data corruption or unexpected behavior.

**Key Points**:

- **Definition**: Occurs when two or more threads/processes access a shared resource (e.g., memory, database, file) concurrently, and at least one performs a write operation, causing the result to depend on which thread executes first.
- **Cause**: Lack of proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, locks) when accessing shared resources.
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - Two threads handle `POST /v1/tasks` requests to increment a shared `task_counter` (e.g., to assign a new task ID).
  - Without synchronization:
    - Thread 1 reads `task_counter = 100`, intends to set it to 101.
    - Thread 2 reads `task_counter = 100`, intends to set it to 101.
    - Both threads write `101`, resulting in only one increment instead of two, causing a task ID collision.
  - Pseudocode (vulnerable):
    ```pseudo title="pseudo"
    task_counter = read_counter()  // Both threads read 100
    task_counter += 1              // Both increment to 101
    write_counter(task_counter)    // Both write 101, losing one increment
    ```
- **Impact**:
  - Data corruption (e.g., duplicate task IDs).
  - Inconsistent application state (e.g., incorrect task counts).
  - Unpredictable behavior or crashes.
- **Prevention**:
  - **Mutexes/Locks**: Use mutual exclusion to ensure only one thread accesses the resource at a time (e.g., lock `task_counter` during increment).
  - **Atomic Operations**: Use atomic instructions (e.g., `compare-and-swap`) to update shared variables safely.
  - **Semaphores**: Control access to shared resources.
  - **Database Transactions**: Use transactions with proper isolation levels to ensure consistent updates.
  - **Avoid Shared State**: Design systems to minimize shared resources (e.g., use message queues).
- **Example Fix** (using a mutex):
  ```pseudo title="pseudo"
  mutex.lock()
  try {
      task_counter = read_counter()
      task_counter += 1
      write_counter(task_counter)
  } finally {
      mutex.unlock()

- **Use Case**: In a TODO service, race conditions can occur when multiple API requests concurrently update shared resources like task counters, user balances, or task statuses.

In backend development, preventing race conditions is critical for ensuring data integrity and reliability in applications like a TODO service, especially in high-concurrency environments with multiple API requests or database operations.

### What is synchronization?

**Synchronization** in concurrent programming is the coordination of multiple threads or processes to ensure orderly access to shared resources, preventing issues like race conditions, data inconsistencies, or deadlocks. It ensures that operations on shared data are executed in a controlled and predictable manner.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Guarantees that only one thread/process (or a controlled number) accesses a shared resource at a time, maintaining data integrity and consistency.
- **How It Works**: Uses mechanisms to control access, coordinate execution, or signal events between threads/processes.
- **Common Synchronization Mechanisms**:
  - **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)**: Locks a resource so only one thread can access it at a time (e.g., preventing concurrent writes to a task counter).
  - **Semaphore**: Controls access to a resource pool, allowing a set number of threads to proceed (e.g., limiting database connections).
  - **Monitors**: Combine mutexes with condition variables to manage access and wait/notify mechanisms.
  - **Read-Write Locks**: Allow multiple readers or one writer to access a resource concurrently.
  - **Condition Variables**: Enable threads to wait for specific conditions (e.g., a task queue is non-empty).
  - **Atomic Operations**: Perform single, indivisible operations (e.g., incrementing a counter) without locks.
- **Example**: In a TODO service:
  - Multiple threads handle `POST /v1/tasks` requests that increment a shared `task_id` counter.
  - A mutex ensures only one thread increments the counter at a time:
    ```pseudo title="pseudo"
    mutex.lock()
    try {
        task_id = read_counter()
        task_id += 1
        write_counter(task_id)
    } finally {
        mutex.unlock()
    }
    ```
  - This prevents a race condition where two threads might assign the same `task_id`.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Ensuring thread-safe database updates (e.g., adding tasks in a TODO service).
  - Coordinating access to shared memory, files, or network resources.
  - Managing task dependencies (e.g., waiting for a background job to complete).
- **Benefits**:
  - Prevents race conditions and data corruption.
  - Ensures consistent application state.
  - Enables safe concurrent execution.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Overhead**: Synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks) can slow down performance.
  - **Deadlocks**: Improper use can cause threads to wait indefinitely.
  - **Complexity**: Designing correct synchronization logic is error-prone.
- **Contrast with Asynchrony**:
  - **Synchronization**: Threads/processes coordinate explicitly, often blocking until conditions are met.
  - **Asynchrony**: Tasks proceed independently, often using callbacks or events to handle completion.

In backend development, synchronization is critical for applications like a TODO service to manage concurrent API requests or database operations, ensuring data integrity and reliable performance in multi-threaded or distributed environments.
