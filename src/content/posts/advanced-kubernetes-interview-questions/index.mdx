Prepare for your Kubernetes interviews with this curated list of 100 advanced questions covering StatefulSets, service meshes, CRDs, operators, and more.

## What are StatefulSets, and how do they differ from Deployments?

## What is a service mesh, and how is it used in Kubernetes?

## How can you secure a Kubernetes cluster?

## What are Taints and Tolerations in Kubernetes?

## What are Kubernetes sidecar containers, and how are they used?

## Name three typical Pod error causes and how they can be fixed.

## What is a Kubernetes mutating admission webhook, and how does it work?

## How do you implement zero-downtime Deployments in Kubernetes?

## What are Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), and when should you use them?

## What are Kubernetes operators, and how do they work?

## How do you backup and restore an etcd cluster in Kubernetes?

## How do you safely upgrade a Kubernetes cluster?

## How do you encrypt Kubernetes secrets in etcd?

## Debugging a slow Kubernetes application: “Your team reports that an application running in Kubernetes has become slow, and users are experiencing high response times. How do you solve this problem?”

## An Nginx web server is running, but the exposed URL fails to connect: “You deployed an Nginx web server in Kubernetes, and the Pod is running fine, but the application is not accessible via the exposed URL. What can you do about it?”

## Kubernetes Deployment fails after an upgrade: “You deployed a new version of your application, but it fails to start, causing downtime for your users. How can you fix the problem?”

## The application can’t connect to an external database: “A microservice running in Kubernetes fails to connect to an external database, which is hosted outside the cluster. How can you fix the issue?”

## Cluster resources are exhausted, causing new Pods to remain in a pending state: “New pods stay in the state Pending. Looking deeper into the pods, we see that the message ‘0/3 nodes are available: insufficient CPU and memory’. How do you go about debugging and solving the problem?”

## What is the difference between Taints/Tolerations and Node Affinity?

## How would you ensure only ML workloads are scheduled on GPU nodes?

## Explain the concept of Custom Resources in Kubernetes.

## Describe the internals of the Kubernetes control plane.

## Explain the concept of Pod Disruption Budgets.

## What is the role of the kube-controller-manager?

## Describe the role of kube-apiserver in the Kubernetes architecture.

## How does Kubernetes handle node failures and resiliency?

## Explain how to set up and use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes.

## What is the role of the Cloud Controller Manager in a cloud-based Kubernetes cluster?

## Describe a few important Kubectl commands.

## What is Helm of Kubernetes?

## Explain the concept of a Custom Operator in Kubernetes.

## What is the difference between Contoller and Operator.

## What is a "finalizer" used for?

## How to deploy CRDs with Helm?

## Suppose a company built on monolithic architecture handles numerous products. Now, as the company expands in today’s scaling industry, their monolithic architecture started causing problems. How do you think the company shifted from monolithic to microservices and deploy their services containers?

## Consider a multinational company with a very much distributed system, with a large number of data centers, virtual machines, and many employees working on various tasks. How do you think can such a company manage all the tasks in a consistent way with Kubernetes?

## Consider a situation, where a company wants to increase its efficiency and the speed of its technical operations by maintaining minimal costs. How do you think the company will try to achieve this?

## Suppose a company wants to revise its deployment methods and wants to build a platform which is much more scalable and responsive. How do you think this company can achieve this to satisfy their customers?

## Consider a multinational company with a very much distributed system, looking forward to solving the monolithic code base problem. How do you think the company can solve their problem?

## All of us know that the shift from monolithic to microservices solves the problem from the development side, but increases the problem at the deployment side. How can the company solve the problem on the deployment side?

## Suppose a company wants to optimize the distribution of its workloads, by adopting new technologies. How can the company achieve this distribution of resources efficiently?

## Consider a carpooling company wants to increase their number of servers by simultaneously scaling their platform. How do you think will the company deal with the servers and their installation?

## Consider a scenario where a company wants to provide all the required hand-outs to its customers having various environments. How do you think they can achieve this critical target in a dynamic manner?

## Suppose a company wants to run various workloads on different cloud infrastructure from bare metal to a public cloud. How will the company achieve this in the presence of different interfaces?
