## Explain the Go memory model.

The Go memory model defines how goroutines share data and synchronize memory access in concurrent programs. It ensures predictable behavior in a concurrent environment.

**Key Concepts**:

- **Goroutines**: Lightweight threads that run concurrently. Each has its own stack, but they share the same memory heap.
- **Memory Access**: Reads and writes to shared variables can lead to race conditions if not synchronized properly.
- **Synchronization**: Go provides mechanisms like channels, mutexes, and the `sync` package to coordinate memory access. Channels are preferred for communication between goroutines, ensuring safe data exchange.
- **Happens-Before**: The model guarantees that certain operations (e.g., sending on a channel) complete before others (e.g., receiving from it). For example, a write to a variable before a channel send is visible to a goroutine after the corresponding receive.
- **Atomicity**: Operations on shared variables aren't guaranteed to be atomic unless using `sync/atomic` primitives.

**Practical Implications**:

- Avoid shared mutable state when possible; use channels for communication.
- Use `sync.Mutex` or `sync.RWMutex` for explicit locking when shared state is unavoidable.
- Tools like the race detector (`go run -race`) help identify unsafe memory access.

This ensures safe, predictable concurrency in Go programs.

## What is escape analysis in Go?

Escape analysis in Go is a compiler optimization technique that determines whether a variable's memory allocation should be on the stack or the heap.

**Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: The Go compiler analyzes a variable's lifetime and scope to decide its allocation. If a variable "escapes" its scope (e.g., is referenced outside its function), it’s allocated on the heap; otherwise, it’s on the stack.
- **Stack vs. Heap**: Stack allocation is faster and automatically reclaimed, while heap allocation involves garbage collection, which is slower.
- **How It Works**: The compiler checks if a variable is passed to another function, returned, or stored in a global variable. If so, it escapes to the heap. For example, returning a pointer or assigning to a slice causes escape.
- **Benefits**: Reduces heap allocations, improving performance by minimizing garbage collection overhead.
- **Example**:
  ```go title="Go"
  func foo() *int {
      x := 42
      return &x // x escapes to heap
  }
  func bar() {
      y := 42 // y stays on stack
      fmt.Println(y)
  }
  ```
- **Inspecting**: Use `go build -gcflags="-m"` to see escape analysis decisions.

This optimization enhances Go’s efficiency in memory management for concurrent programs.

## How does the garbage collector work in Go?

Go’s garbage collector (GC) manages memory by automatically reclaiming unused objects, ensuring efficient memory use in concurrent programs.

**Key Mechanics**:

- **Mark-and-Sweep**: Go uses a concurrent mark-and-sweep GC. It identifies live objects (mark phase) and reclaims memory from unused ones (sweep phase).
- **Tri-color Algorithm**: Objects are classified as white (unvisited), grey (to be scanned), or black (live). The GC marks live objects starting from roots (e.g., stack, globals), moving them from white to grey to black, then sweeps white objects.
- **Concurrency**: The GC runs concurrently with the program, minimizing pauses. Goroutines assist in marking, and sweeping happens in the background.
- **Pacing**: The GC adjusts its frequency based on memory allocation rate, controlled by the `GOGC` environment variable (default 100, meaning GC runs when heap doubles).
- **Low Latency**: Go’s GC is designed for low-latency applications, with short stop-the-world pauses (typically microseconds).

**Practical Impact**:

- Developers don’t manage memory manually, but escape analysis affects GC load (heap allocations increase work).
- Use `runtime.GC()` or `runtime.MemStats` for manual control or monitoring.
- Optimize by reducing allocations (e.g., reusing objects, avoiding unnecessary pointers).

This ensures efficient memory management for scalable Go applications.

## What are the internals of slices?

In Go, a slice is a lightweight data structure that provides a flexible view into an underlying array. Understanding its internals is key for efficient memory management and performance in backend development.

**Key Components**:

- **Pointer**: Points to the underlying array’s starting element.
- **Length**: The number of elements in the slice (`len(slice)`).
- **Capacity**: The number of elements the underlying array can hold from the slice’s start (`cap(slice)`).

**How It Works**:

- A slice is a struct-like descriptor: `{ptr, len, cap}`. It doesn’t own data but references a contiguous segment of an array.
- Slicing an array or slice (e.g., `arr[i:j]`) creates a new slice pointing to the same array, adjusting `ptr`, `len`, and `cap`.
- Appending to a slice (`append`) uses the underlying array if capacity allows; otherwise, it allocates a new, larger array, copying data, which can impact performance.
- Modifying a slice’s elements affects the underlying array, potentially impacting other slices sharing it.

**Practical Notes**:

- Check capacity with `cap()` to avoid unnecessary allocations.
- Use `make([]T, len, cap)` to preallocate capacity.
- Passing slices to functions is efficient (only copies the descriptor).

This structure enables dynamic resizing while maintaining performance, critical for backend systems handling large datasets.

## Explain the implementation of maps in Go.

**Structure**: Go maps are hash tables with an array of buckets, each holding up to 8 key-value pairs, a `tophash` array for fast key matching, and an overflow pointer for collisions. The `hmap` struct tracks bucket count (power of 2), entry count, and hash seed.

**Operations**: Keys are hashed to select a bucket, using the top 8 bits for quick lookups. Lookup, insertion, and deletion are O(1) on average. Maps grow when the load factor exceeds ~6.5 or overflow buckets increase, doubling buckets and rehashing keys lazily.

**Memory Management**: Maps are heap-allocated, managed by the garbage collector. Preallocating with `make(map[K]V, hint)` minimizes resizing. Keys must be comparable (no slices or maps).

**Concurrency**: Maps are not thread-safe; use `sync.Mutex` or `sync.Map` for concurrency. The `-race` flag detects misuse.

**Practical Notes**: Iteration is randomized for security. Use `go build -gcflags="-m"` to check heap allocation. This ensures efficient, scalable performance for backend systems.

## How does scheduling work for goroutines?

Go’s runtime scheduler manages goroutines, lightweight threads, using a work-stealing, cooperative model for efficient concurrency on multicore systems.

**Components**:

- **G**: Represents a goroutine, including its stack and program counter.
- **M**: Represents an OS thread, executing goroutines.
- **P**: Represents a logical processor, holding a run queue of goroutines. The number of Ps is set by `GOMAXPROCS` (usually CPU cores).

**Scheduling Process**:

- The scheduler assigns each goroutine (G) to a processor (P) run queue. Each P is bound to an OS thread (M).
- Goroutines run until they yield (e.g., I/O, channel operations, or `runtime.Gosched()`), allowing cooperative scheduling.
- The scheduler uses **work-stealing**: if a P’s run queue is empty, it steals goroutines from another P’s queue, balancing load.
- A global run queue handles overflow or blocked Ps.

**Key Features**:

- Preemptive scheduling (since Go 1.14) interrupts long-running goroutines at safe points (e.g., function calls).
- System calls or blocking operations park goroutines, freeing the M for other work.
- Use `runtime.GOMAXPROCS` to tune parallelism.

This ensures efficient, scalable concurrency for backend applications.

## What is the GOMAXPROCS setting?

`GOMAXPROCS` is a Go runtime setting that determines the maximum number of logical processors (Ps) the scheduler uses to run goroutines concurrently. It controls the degree of parallelism in a Go program.

**How It Works**:

- By default, `GOMAXPROCS` equals the number of CPU cores available, maximizing CPU utilization.
- Each logical processor (P) manages a run queue of goroutines and is bound to an OS thread (M).
- Setting `GOMAXPROCS` limits how many threads can execute goroutines simultaneously.

**Configuration**:

- Set via `runtime.GOMAXPROCS(n)` in code or the `GOMAXPROCS` environment variable.
- Example: `GOMAXPROCS=4` allows up to 4 threads to run goroutines concurrently.

**Practical Notes**:

- Increasing `GOMAXPROCS` can improve performance for CPU-bound tasks but may increase contention for I/O-bound tasks.
- Setting it too high can lead to thread overhead or contention.
- Use `runtime.NumCPU()` to query available cores for dynamic tuning.
- Check impact with profiling tools like `pprof`.

This setting is critical for optimizing concurrency in backend applications, balancing parallelism and resource usage.

## Explain channel internals and blocking.

**Channel Internals and Blocking**

Channels in Go are synchronized communication primitives for passing data between goroutines, ensuring safe concurrency.

**Internals**:

- Channels are implemented as a `hchan` struct in the runtime, containing a circular buffer (for buffered channels), a lock, and pointers to send/receive queues.
- Key fields: `qcount` (current items), `dataqsiz` (buffer size), `buf` (buffer array), `sendx`/`recvx` (send/receive indices), and `lock` for synchronization.
- Unbuffered channels (`make(chan T)`) have no buffer; buffered channels (`make(chan T, n)`) store up to `n` elements.

**Blocking Behavior**:

- **Unbuffered Channels**: Sending blocks until a receiver is ready, and receiving blocks until a sender is ready. The runtime synchronizes goroutines, parking the sender/receiver in a wait queue until paired.
- **Buffered Channels**: Sending blocks only if the buffer is full; receiving blocks if the buffer is empty. The runtime manages the circular buffer, copying data directly.
- Closing a channel unblocks all waiting goroutines, signaling no more data.

**Concurrency**:

- Channels use locks for thread safety but minimize contention.
- Use `select` for non-blocking or multi-channel operations.

This ensures safe, efficient data exchange in concurrent backend systems.

## How do you implement custom synchronization primitives?

**Custom Synchronization Primitives**

Custom synchronization primitives in Go are built using low-level constructs from the `sync` and `sync/atomic` packages to coordinate goroutines safely.

**Key Approaches**:

- **Mutex-Based**: Use `sync.Mutex` or `sync.RWMutex` for locking. For example, create a custom counter with `Mutex` to protect shared state:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Counter struct {
      mu    sync.Mutex
      count int
  }
  func (c *Counter) Inc() {
      c.mu.Lock()
      c.count++
      c.mu.Unlock()
  }
  ```
- **Atomic Operations**: Use `sync/atomic` for lock-free primitives. For example, an atomic counter:
  ```go title="Go"
  type AtomicCounter struct {
      count int64
  }
  func (c *AtomicCounter) Inc() {
      atomic.AddInt64(&c.count, 1)
  }
  ```
- **Channel-Based**: Use channels for synchronization without shared state. For example, a worker pool with a semaphore-like channel:
  ```go title="Go"
  func WorkerPool(n int) chan struct{} {
      sem := make(chan struct{}, n)
      return sem
  }
  ```

**Practical Notes**:

- Prefer `sync` primitives over custom ones unless specific behavior is needed.
- Use `sync.Cond` for complex signaling patterns.
- Test with `-race` to detect data races.

This ensures safe, efficient concurrency for backend systems.

## What are generics in Go, and how do they work?

**Generics in Go**

Generics in Go allow functions and types to work with multiple data types while maintaining type safety, introduced in Go 1.18.

**How They Work**:

- **Type Parameters**: Functions or types are defined with type parameters in square brackets. For example:
  ```go title="Go"
  func Print[T any](value T) {
      fmt.Println(value)
  }
  ```
  Here, `T` is a type parameter, and `any` is a constraint allowing any type.
- **Constraints**: Define allowed types using interfaces (e.g., `constraints.Ordered` for comparable types like `int`, `float64`). Custom constraints can be defined:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Number interface {
      int | float64
  }
  func Add[T Number](a, b T) T {
      return a + b
  }
  ```
- **Type Inference**: The compiler infers types when possible, e.g., `Print(42)` infers `T` as `int`.
- **Generic Types**: Structs or slices can use type parameters, e.g., `type Stack[T any] []T`.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use generics for reusable, type-safe code, like collections or algorithms.
- Avoid overuse to maintain simplicity.
- Check compatibility with `go vet` or `golangci-lint`.

This enhances flexibility and safety in backend development.

## Explain type parameters in functions.

**Type Parameters in Functions**

Type parameters in Go functions, introduced in Go 1.18, enable generic programming by allowing functions to operate on multiple types while preserving type safety.

**Definition**:

- Type parameters are declared in square brackets before the function’s parameter list. For example:
  ```go title="Go"
  func Min[T constraints.Ordered](a, b T) T {
      if a < b {
          return a
      }
      return b
  }
  ```
  Here, `T` is the type parameter, and `constraints.Ordered` restricts `T` to comparable types like `int`, `float64`, or `string`.

**How They Work**:

- **Constraints**: Specify allowed types using interfaces (e.g., `any` for all types, `constraints.Ordered` for comparable types). Custom constraints can be defined:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Number interface {
      int | float64
  }
  func Add[T Number](a, b T) T {
      return a + b
  }
  ```
- **Type Inference**: The compiler infers the type from arguments, e.g., `Min(5, 10)` infers `T` as `int`.
- **Instantiation**: The compiler generates type-specific versions of the function at compile time.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use for reusable logic, like sorting or collections.
- Keep constraints simple to maintain clarity.
- Verify with `go vet` for type safety.

This boosts flexibility in backend development.

## How do you use constraints with generics?

**Using Constraints with Generics**

Constraints in Go generics, introduced in Go 1.18, define the allowed types for type parameters in functions or types, ensuring type safety and flexibility.

**Definition**:

- Constraints are interfaces that specify permissible types. They are used in type parameter declarations, e.g.:
  ```go title="Go"
  func Max[T constraints.Ordered](a, b T) T {
      if a > b {
          return a
      }
      return b
  }
  ```
  Here, `constraints.Ordered` restricts `T` to types supporting comparison (`<`, `>`, `==`), like `int`, `float64`, or `string`.

**How They Work**:

- **Predefined Constraints**: The `golang.org/x/exp/constraints` package provides common constraints, e.g., `Ordered` or `Integer`.
- **Custom Constraints**: Define your own using union types or interfaces:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Number interface {
      int | float64 | int32
  }
  func Add[T Number](a, b T) T {
      return a + b
  }
  ```
- **Type Inference**: The compiler infers `T` from arguments, e.g., `Add(1.5, 2.5)` sets `T` to `float64`.
- **Any Constraint**: Use `any` for unrestricted types, equivalent to an empty interface.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use constraints to enforce type safety in generic functions.
- Keep constraints minimal for clarity.
- Test with `go vet` to ensure correctness.

This enhances reusable, safe code in backend development.

## What is the runtime package, and what can you do with it?

**Runtime Package**

The `runtime` package in Go provides low-level functions to interact with the Go runtime system, managing goroutines, memory, and system resources.

**Key Functionalities**:

- **Goroutine Management**:
  - `runtime.Gosched()`: Yields execution to another goroutine.
  - `runtime.Goexit()`: Terminates the calling goroutine cleanly.
  - `runtime.NumGoroutine()`: Returns the current number of goroutines.
- **Concurrency Control**:
  - `runtime.GOMAXPROCS(n)`: Sets the number of logical processors for scheduling.
  - `runtime.LockOSThread()`: Binds a goroutine to its OS thread.
- **Memory Management**:
  - `runtime.GC()`: Triggers garbage collection manually.
  - `runtime.MemStats`: Provides memory usage statistics.
  - `runtime.ReadMemStats(m)`: Populates memory stats for analysis.
- **Debugging and Profiling**:
  - `runtime.SetBlockProfileRate`: Configures blocking event profiling.
  - `runtime.Stack`: Captures stack traces for debugging.
- **System Information**:
  - `runtime.NumCPU()`: Returns the number of CPU cores.
  - `runtime.GOOS`, `runtime.GOARCH`: Provide OS and architecture details.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use sparingly, as it’s low-level and can impact portability.
- Ideal for performance tuning, debugging, or custom scheduling in backend systems.
- Profile with `pprof` alongside `runtime` for optimization.
- Avoid overuse to maintain simplicity and safety.

This enables fine-grained control over runtime behavior in Go applications.

## Explain cgo and interfacing with C code.

**cgo and Interfacing with C Code**

cgo enables Go programs to call C code and libraries, facilitating integration with existing C-based systems.

**Definition**:

- cgo is a tool in Go that allows Go code to interoperate with C by generating glue code for function calls and type conversions.

**How It Works**:

- **C Code Inclusion**: Use `import "C"` with `// #include` directives in comments to include C headers or inline C code:
  ```go title="Go"
  // #include <stdio.h>
  import "C"
  func print() {
      C.puts(C.CString("Hello"))
  }
  ```
- **Type Mapping**: Go types map to C types (e.g., `C.int` for C’s `int`). Use `C.CString` to convert Go strings to C-compatible strings.
- **Calling C Functions**: Invoke C functions directly via the `C` package, e.g., `C.someFunction()`.
- **Memory Management**: Manually manage C memory (e.g., `C.free` for `C.CString`) to avoid leaks, as Go’s GC doesn’t handle C memory.

**Practical Notes**:

- Enable with `// #cgo` directives for compiler flags (e.g., `// #cgo LDFLAGS: -lm`).
- Use for performance-critical code or legacy C libraries.
- Be cautious of performance overhead and safety risks.
- Test with `-race` and profile with `pprof`.

This bridges Go with C for backend system integration.

## How do you profile a Go program?

**Profiling a Go Program**

Profiling a Go program involves analyzing performance metrics like CPU, memory, and goroutine usage to identify bottlenecks.

**Key Tools**:

- **pprof**: Built-in tool for collecting and analyzing profiling data.
  - Enable with `import "net/http/pprof"` for HTTP endpoints or `runtime/pprof` for manual collection.
  - Example: Start HTTP server with `http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)` to access `/debug/pprof/`.
- **go tool pprof**: Analyzes profiles to generate reports (e.g., CPU, heap, goroutine).

**Profiling Steps**:

- **CPU Profiling**: Use `pprof.StartCPUProfile(file)` to capture CPU usage. Run `go tool pprof cpu.prof` to analyze hotspots.
- **Memory Profiling**: Use `runtime.MemStats` or `pprof.WriteHeapProfile(file)` to track allocations. Analyze with `go tool pprof heap.prof`.
- **Goroutine Profiling**: Access `/debug/pprof/goroutine` or use `runtime.NumGoroutine()` to monitor goroutine leaks.
- **Visualization**: Use `go tool pprof -http=:8080 prof` for interactive web UI or generate flame graphs.

**Practical Notes**:

- Add `-race` flag to detect data races during profiling.
- Use `runtime.SetBlockProfileRate` for blocking events.
- Profile in production-like environments for accuracy.
- Minimize overhead by sampling selectively.

This ensures optimized performance in backend Go applications.

## What is pprof, and how is it used?

**pprof**

pprof is Go’s built-in profiling tool for analyzing performance metrics like CPU, memory, and goroutines to identify bottlenecks.

**Usage**:

- **Enable Profiling**:
  - Import `net/http/pprof` to expose profiling endpoints via HTTP (`/debug/pprof/`).
  - Alternatively, use `runtime/pprof` for manual profile collection.
  - Example: Start HTTP server with `http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)`.

- **Collect Profiles**:
  - **CPU**: Use `pprof.StartCPUProfile(file)` to record CPU usage, stopped with `pprof.StopCPUProfile()`.
  - **Memory**: Use `pprof.WriteHeapProfile(file)` or access `/debug/pprof/heap` for allocation data.
  - **Goroutines**: Access `/debug/pprof/goroutine` to inspect running goroutines.

- **Analyze Profiles**:
  - Run `go tool pprof <profile-file>` or `go tool pprof http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/<type>` to analyze.
  - Use interactive mode (`top`, `list`, `web`) or generate flame graphs for visualization.

**Practical Notes**:

- Profile in production-like environments for accuracy.
- Use `go tool pprof -http=:8080` for a web-based UI.
- Combine with `-race` to detect data races.
- Minimize overhead by limiting profiling duration.

This helps optimize backend Go applications by pinpointing performance issues efficiently.

## Explain tracing in Go.

**Tracing in Go**

Tracing in Go tracks the execution flow of a program, capturing events like goroutine activity, network requests, and system calls to analyze performance and latency.

**Key Tools**:

- **runtime/trace**: Built-in package for collecting trace data.
- **go tool trace**: Analyzes trace data with a web-based UI.

**How It Works**:

- **Enable Tracing**:
  - Import `runtime/trace` and start tracing with `trace.Start(file)`. Stop with `trace.Stop()`.
  - Example:
    ```go title="Go"
    f, _ := os.Create("trace.out")
    trace.Start(f)
    defer trace.Stop()
    ```
- **Collect Data**: Captures events like goroutine scheduling, garbage collection, and syscalls.
- **Analyze Traces**:
  - Run `go tool trace trace.out` to open a web UI.
  - Visualize timelines, goroutine interactions, and bottlenecks.
  - Identify delays in scheduling, I/O, or GC pauses.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use for diagnosing latency or concurrency issues in backend systems.
- Combine with `pprof` for CPU/memory insights.
- Minimize overhead by tracing short durations in production-like environments.
- Ensure sufficient disk space for trace files.
- Use `net/http/pprof` for integration with HTTP servers.

This enables detailed performance analysis, optimizing complex Go applications.

## How do you optimize Go code for performance?

**Optimizing Go Code for Performance**

Optimizing Go code enhances execution speed and resource efficiency in backend applications.

**Key Strategies**:

- **Profiling**: Use `pprof` (`net/http/pprof`) to identify CPU/memory bottlenecks. Analyze with `go tool pprof` to find hotspots.
- **Reduce Allocations**: Minimize heap allocations via escape analysis (`go build -gcflags="-m"`). Use stack allocation or reuse objects (e.g., sync.Pool).
- **Concurrency**: Leverage goroutines and channels for parallelism. Tune `GOMAXPROCS` for optimal CPU usage. Avoid excessive goroutines to reduce scheduling overhead.
- **Data Structures**: Choose efficient types (e.g., slices over maps for sequential access). Preallocate slices/maps with `make` to avoid resizing.
- **Algorithms**: Optimize algorithms for time complexity. Use `sync/atomic` for lock-free operations in hot paths.
- **Garbage Collection**: Monitor GC with `runtime.MemStats`. Reduce GC pressure by minimizing allocations and using value types.
- **Benchmarking**: Write benchmarks with `testing` package (`go test -bench`). Compare optimizations iteratively.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use `go vet` and `-race` to catch errors and data races.
- Profile in production-like environments for accuracy.
- Avoid premature optimization; focus on measurable bottlenecks.

This ensures fast, scalable Go applications.

## What are the best practices for error handling in large applications?

**Error Handling Best Practices**

Effective error handling in large Go applications ensures robustness and maintainability.

**Key Practices**:

- **Explicit Checks**: Always check errors explicitly using `if err != nil`. Avoid ignoring errors to prevent silent failures.
- **Wrap Errors**: Use `fmt.Errorf` or `errors.Wrap` (from `github.com/pkg/errors`) to add context:
  ```go title="Go"
  if err != nil {
      return fmt.Errorf("failed to process: %w", err)
  }
  ```
- **Custom Errors**: Define custom error types with `errors.New` or structs implementing the `error` interface for specific cases:
  ```go title="Go"
  type NotFoundError struct { ID string }
  func (e NotFoundError) Error() string { return "not found: " + e.ID }
  ```
- **Centralized Handling**: Use middleware or handlers in HTTP servers to centralize error responses, ensuring consistent logging and user feedback.
- **Avoid Panic**: Reserve `panic` for unrecoverable errors; use `defer` with `recover` sparingly for crash recovery.
- **Logging**: Log errors with context (e.g., `logrus`) at appropriate levels (error, warn) for debugging.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use `errors.Is` and `errors.As` for type-safe error checks.
- Test error paths with `testing` package.
- Keep error messages clear and actionable.

This ensures reliable, debuggable large-scale Go applications.

## Explain context propagation in distributed systems.

**Context Propagation in Distributed Systems**

Context propagation in Go enables passing request-scoped data, like deadlines and cancellation signals, across distributed systems.

**Definition**:

- The `context` package provides `Context` to carry deadlines, cancellation, and key-value pairs between processes or services.

**How It Works**:

- **Creating Contexts**:
  - Use `context.Background()` as the root context or `context.TODO()` for temporary placeholders.
  - Derive contexts with `context.WithCancel`, `context.WithDeadline`, or `context.WithTimeout` to add cancellation or timeouts.
- **Propagation**:
  - Pass the `Context` through function calls or API requests (e.g., in HTTP headers or gRPC metadata).
  - Example: Attach trace IDs in HTTP headers:
    ```go title="Go"
    ctx := context.WithValue(context.Background(), "traceID", "123")
    req := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, "GET", url, nil)
    ```
- **Cancellation**: Child contexts inherit cancellation. Calling `cancel()` on a parent context propagates to all derived contexts, stopping related tasks.
- **Values**: Store request-scoped data (e.g., user IDs) using `context.WithValue`, accessed via `ctx.Value(key)`.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use for timeouts, cancellations, and tracing in microservices.
- Avoid overusing `Value` for passing complex data; prefer explicit parameters.
- Test with `context.Canceled` or `context.DeadlineExceeded` to ensure robustness.

This ensures coordinated, reliable communication in distributed backend systems.

## How do you implement rate limiting in Go?

**Rate Limiting in Go**

Rate limiting in Go controls request frequency to prevent system overload in backend applications.

**Key Approaches**:

- **Token Bucket Algorithm**: Use `golang.org/x/time/rate` for a token bucket limiter:
  ```go title="Go"
  limiter := rate.NewLimiter(rate.Limit(10), 10) // 10 req/s, burst of 10
  if !limiter.Allow() {
      return fmt.Errorf("rate limit exceeded")
  }
  ```
- **Middleware for HTTP**: Apply rate limiting in HTTP handlers:
  ```go title="Go"
  func RateLimit(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
      limiter := rate.NewLimiter(10, 10)
      return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
          if !limiter.Allow() {
              http.Error(w, "Too Many Requests", http.StatusTooManyRequests)
              return
          }
          next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
      })
  }
  ```
- **Per-Client Limiting**: Use a map with mutex or `sync.Map` to track client limits (e.g., by IP).
- **Distributed Limiting**: Use Redis or external services for shared rate limits across instances.

**Practical Notes**:

- Tune rate and burst based on load testing.
- Log or return `429 Too Many Requests` for clarity.
- Use `context` for cancellation in long-running requests.
- Test with tools like `wrk` for performance.

This ensures scalable, protected backend services.

## What is gRPC, and how do you use it in Go?

**gRPC in Go**

gRPC is a high-performance, open-source RPC framework using HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers for efficient, type-safe communication in distributed systems.

**Key Features**:

- Supports bidirectional streaming, multiplexing, and low-latency communication.
- Uses `.proto` files to define services and messages, compiled into Go code.

**Usage in Go**:

- **Define Service**: Create a `.proto` file:
  ```proto
  service Greeter {
      rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
  }
  message HelloRequest { string name = 1; }
  message HelloReply { string message = 1; }
  ```
- **Generate Code**: Run `protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. service.proto` to generate Go stubs.
- **Implement Server**:
  ```go title="Go"
  type server struct{ grpc.UnimplementedGreeterServer }
  func (s *server) SayHello(ctx context.Context, req *pb.HelloRequest) (*pb.HelloReply, error) {
      return &pb.HelloReply{Message: "Hello, " + req.Name}, nil
  }
  func main() {
      lis, _ := net.Listen("tcp", ":50051")
      s := grpc.NewServer()
      pb.RegisterGreeterServer(s, &server{})
      s.Serve(lis)
  }
  ```
- **Client**:
  ```go title="Go"
  conn, _ := grpc.Dial("localhost:50051", grpc.WithInsecure())
  client := pb.NewGreeterClient(conn)
  resp, _ := client.SayHello(context.Background(), &pb.HelloRequest{Name: "World"})
  fmt.Println(resp.Message)
  ```

**Practical Notes**:

- Use `context` for timeouts/cancellation.
- Add middleware for logging or auth.
- Test with `grpcurl` for debugging.

This enables scalable, efficient microservices.

## Explain protocol buffers in Go.

**Protocol Buffers in Go**

Protocol Buffers (protobuf) is a language-agnostic, binary serialization format for efficient data exchange in distributed systems.

**Definition**:

- Protobuf defines structured data in `.proto` files, compiled into Go code for type-safe serialization/deserialization.

**How It Works**:

- **Define Schema**: Create a `.proto` file:
  ```proto
  message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
  }
  ```
- **Generate Code**: Run `protoc --go_out=. schema.proto` to generate Go structs with serialization methods.
- **Serialization**:
  ```go title="Go"
  p := &pb.Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}
  data, _ := proto.Marshal(p) // Serialize to bytes
  ```
- **Deserialization**:
  ```go title="Go"
  var p2 pb.Person
  proto.Unmarshal(data, &p2) // Deserialize to struct
  fmt.Println(p2.Name, p2.Age)
  ```

**Key Features**:

- Compact binary format reduces size and improves speed over JSON/XML.
- Backward-compatible schema evolution (e.g., adding fields).
- Used with gRPC for efficient RPC communication.

**Practical Notes**:

- Install `protoc` and `github.com/golang/protobuf`.
- Use `protoc-gen-go` for code generation.
- Validate schemas with `protoc --lint`.
- Combine with gRPC for microservices or standalone for data storage.

This ensures efficient, scalable data handling in backend Go applications.

## How do you handle authentication in Go web services?

**Handling Authentication in Go Web Services**

Authentication in Go web services verifies user identity to secure endpoints.

**Key Approaches**:

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**:
  - Use `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt` to issue and verify tokens.
  - Example middleware:
    ```go title="Go"
    func AuthMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
        return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            tokenStr := r.Header.Get("Authorization")
            token, _ := jwt.Parse(tokenStr, func(token *jwt.Token) (interface{}, error) {
                return []byte("secret"), nil
            })
            if token.Valid {
                next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
            } else {
                http.Error(w, "Unauthorized", http.StatusUnauthorized)
            }
        })
    }
    ```
- **Session-Based**:
  - Use `github.com/gorilla/sessions` for cookie-based sessions.
  - Store user ID in a secure cookie after login.
- **OAuth2**:
  - Use `golang.org/x/oauth2` for third-party auth (e.g., Google).
  - Redirect users to provider, exchange code for token.
- **Basic Auth**:
  - Use `http.BasicAuth` for simple username/password checks.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use HTTPS to encrypt traffic.
- Store secrets securely (e.g., environment variables).
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Log auth failures with `logrus` for monitoring.
- Test with `go test` to ensure security.

This ensures secure, scalable authentication for Go web services.

## What are websockets, and how do you implement them in Go?

**WebSockets in Go**

WebSockets provide full-duplex, persistent communication channels over a single TCP connection, ideal for real-time applications.

**Definition**:

- WebSockets enable bidirectional, low-latency communication between client and server, unlike HTTP’s request-response model.

**Implementation in Go**:

- **Library**: Use `github.com/gorilla/websocket` for WebSocket support.
- **Server Setup**:

  ```go title="Go"
  import "github.com/gorilla/websocket"

  var upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{
      CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool { return true },
  }

  func handleWS(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      conn, _ := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)
      defer conn.Close()
      for {
          msgType, msg, _ := conn.ReadMessage()
          conn.WriteMessage(msgType, msg) // Echo message
      }
  }

  func main() {
      http.HandleFunc("/ws", handleWS)
      http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
  }
  ```

- **Client**: Use `websocket.Dial` or JavaScript for browser-based clients.
- **Messages**: Read/write JSON or binary data with `conn.ReadJSON`/`conn.WriteJSON`.

**Practical Notes**:

- Handle errors and connection closures gracefully.
- Use `context` for cancellation.
- Implement heartbeats to detect broken connections.
- Secure with TLS (`wss://`) and validate origins.
- Test with tools like `wscat`.

This enables real-time features in Go backend applications.

## Explain the os/exec package for running commands.

**os/exec Package**

The `os/exec` package in Go runs external commands and manages their input, output, and lifecycle.

**Key Features**:

- **Command Execution**: Create a command with `exec.Command(name, args...)`:
  ```go title="Go"
  cmd := exec.Command("ls", "-l")
  ```
- **Running Commands**:
  - `cmd.Run()`: Executes and waits for completion, returning an error if non-zero exit.
  - `cmd.Start()`: Runs asynchronously; use `cmd.Wait()` to wait for completion.
- **Output Handling**:
  - `cmd.Output()`: Returns stdout as a byte slice.
  - `cmd.CombinedOutput()`: Returns stdout and stderr combined.
  - Example:
    ```go title="Go"
    out, _ := exec.Command("echo", "hello").Output()
    fmt.Println(string(out)) // Prints "hello"
    ```
- **Input/Output Streams**: Use `cmd.Stdin`, `cmd.Stdout`, and `cmd.Stderr` for custom I/O handling (e.g., pipes).
- **Process Control**: Use `cmd.Process` to send signals (e.g., `cmd.Process.Kill()`).

**Practical Notes**:

- Handle errors explicitly to catch command failures.
- Sanitize inputs to prevent command injection.
- Use `context` with `exec.CommandContext` for cancellation/timeout:
  ```go title="Go"
  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
  defer cancel()
  cmd := exec.CommandContext(ctx, "sleep", "10")
  ```
- Test with `go test` to verify command behavior.

This enables robust command execution in Go backends.

## How do you build concurrent pipelines in Go?

**Concurrent Pipelines in Go**

Concurrent pipelines in Go process data in stages using goroutines and channels for efficient, parallel execution.

**Key Approach**:

- **Stages**: Break processing into independent functions, each running in a goroutine.
- **Channels**: Connect stages with channels for data flow and synchronization.
- **Example**:
  ```go title="Go"
  func generator(ch chan<- int) {
      for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
          ch <- i
      }
      close(ch)
  }
  func square(in <-chan int, out chan<- int) {
      for n := range in {
          out <- n * n
      }
      close(out)
  }
  func main() {
      ch1 := make(chan int)
      ch2 := make(chan int)
      go generator(ch1)
      go square(ch1, ch2)
      for n := range ch2 {
          fmt.Println(n)
      }
  }
  ```

**Implementation Tips**:

- **Buffered Channels**: Use `make(chan T, n)` to reduce blocking.
- **Cancellation**: Use `context.Context` to propagate cancellation:
  ```go title="Go"
  ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
  defer cancel()
  ```
- **Fan-Out/Fan-In**: Launch multiple goroutines per stage for parallelism, merge results with a collector channel.
- **Error Handling**: Pass errors through a dedicated channel or use `errgroup`.

**Practical Notes**:

- Test with `-race` to detect data races.
- Profile with `pprof` to optimize performance.
- Close channels to signal completion.

This ensures scalable, efficient data processing in backend systems.

## What is the embed directive in Go?

**Embed Directive in Go**

The `//go:embed` directive, introduced in Go 1.16, embeds files or directories into a Go binary at compile time.

**How It Works**:

- **Syntax**: Place `//go:embed pattern` above a variable declaration to embed files matching the pattern.
- **Supported Types**: Embeds into `string`, `[]byte`, or `embed.FS` variables.
- **Example**:

  ```go title="Go"
  import "embed"

  //go:embed static/index.html
  var index string

  //go:embed static/*
  var files embed.FS

  func main() {
      fmt.Println(index) // Embedded file content
      data, _ := files.ReadFile("static/style.css")
      fmt.Println(string(data))
  }
  ```

- **Patterns**: Use wildcards (e.g., `static/*`) to embed multiple files. Paths are relative to the source file.

**Key Features**:

- Embeds files into the binary, eliminating external dependencies.
- `embed.FS` provides a read-only file system for accessing multiple files.
- Supports text, binary files, or directories.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use for static assets (e.g., HTML, CSS) in web servers.
- Ensure patterns are specific to avoid embedding unnecessary files.
- Check file sizes, as embedding increases binary size.
- Test with `go test` to verify embedded content.

This simplifies asset management in Go backend applications.

## Explain fuzz testing in Go.

**Fuzz Testing in Go**

Fuzz testing in Go automatically generates random inputs to test code robustness, introduced in Go 1.18.

**Definition**:

- Fuzzing finds edge cases and bugs by feeding random or mutated inputs to functions.

**How It Works**:

- **Fuzz Test Setup**: Write a fuzz test using `testing.T` with a `Fuzz` prefix:
  ```go title="Go"
  func FuzzParseInt(f *testing.F) {
      f.Add("123") // Seed initial input
      f.Fuzz(func(t *testing.T, s string) {
          _, err := strconv.Atoi(s)
          if err != nil {
              t.Skip() // Ignore invalid inputs
          }
      })
  }
  ```
- **Running**: Use `go test -fuzz=FuzzParseInt` to generate and test random inputs.
- **Corpus**: Seed inputs with `f.Add` to guide fuzzing. Failed inputs are saved for reproduction.

**Key Features**:

- Automatically mutates inputs to explore edge cases.
- Integrates with `go test` for seamless testing.
- Stops on failures, saving inputs to `testdata/fuzz`.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use for critical functions (e.g., parsers, validators).
- Limit runtime with `-fuzztime` to control duration.
- Combine with unit tests for comprehensive coverage.
- Review failed inputs to fix bugs.

This enhances reliability in Go backend applications.

## How do you secure Go applications against common vulnerabilities?

**Securing Go Applications**

Securing Go applications involves mitigating common vulnerabilities to ensure robust backend systems.

**Key Practices**:

- **Input Validation**: Sanitize inputs using packages like `validator` to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL, command). Avoid direct string concatenation.
- **HTTPS**: Use TLS with `http.ListenAndServeTLS` to encrypt traffic. Obtain certificates via Let’s Encrypt.
- **Authentication**: Implement JWT (`github.com/golang-jwt/jwt`) or OAuth2 (`golang.org/x/oauth2`) for secure user authentication. Store secrets in environment variables.
- **Authorization**: Use role-based access control (RBAC) with libraries like `casbin`. Restrict endpoints with middleware.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Escape HTML outputs with `html/template`. Validate user inputs strictly.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Use `github.com/gorilla/csrf` to generate and verify tokens.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies with `go get -u`. Audit with `go list -m` or `govulncheck` for known vulnerabilities.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement with `golang.org/x/time/rate` to prevent abuse.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use `go vet` and `staticcheck` to catch coding errors.
- Enable `-race` flag to detect data races.
- Log securely with `logrus`, avoiding sensitive data.
- Test security with tools like `golangci-lint` or `owasp-zap`.

This ensures protection against common threats in Go applications.

## What are modules proxies and checksum databases?

**Modules Proxies and Checksum Databases**

**Modules Proxies**:

- Go modules proxies are servers that cache Go module source code and metadata, speeding up dependency resolution and builds. The default proxy is `proxy.golang.org`.
- They serve module versions, zip files, and metadata, reducing direct repository access.
- Example: Set `GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct` to use a proxy with fallback to source.
- Use for reliable, fast dependency fetching in backend development.

**Checksum Databases**:

- The checksum database, hosted at `sum.golang.org` by default, stores cryptographic hashes of module content to ensure integrity and authenticity.
- When fetching modules, Go verifies downloaded content against these hashes.
- Example: `go mod download` checks sums against `sum.golang.org`.
- Set `GOSUMDB=off` to disable or use a private database for custom modules.

**Practical Notes**:

- Configure `GOPROXY` and `GOSUMDB` via environment variables or `go.mod`.
- Use private proxies (e.g., JFrog Artifactory) for internal modules.
- Run `go mod verify` to validate local module integrity.
- Monitor with `go list -m` to audit dependencies.

This ensures secure, efficient dependency management in Go applications.

## Explain the build process in Go.

**Go Build Process**

The Go build process compiles source code into executable binaries, optimized for performance and simplicity.

**Stages**:

- **Parsing**: The `go` tool parses `.go` files, checking syntax and generating abstract syntax trees (ASTs).
- **Type Checking**: Validates types and ensures type safety using the AST.
- **Intermediate Representation**: Converts code to an intermediate form for optimization.
- **Optimization**: Applies optimizations like inlining and escape analysis (`go build -gcflags="-m"` to inspect).
- **Code Generation**: Produces machine code for the target architecture (`GOOS`, `GOARCH`).
- **Linking**: Combines object code with runtime and dependencies into a single binary.

**Key Commands**:

- `go build`: Compiles and produces an executable in the current directory.
- `go run`: Compiles and runs without saving the binary.
- `go install`: Builds and installs the binary to `$GOPATH/bin`.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use `-tags` for conditional compilation (e.g., `go build -tags prod`).
- Cross-compile by setting `GOOS` and `GOARCH` (e.g., `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build`).
- Enable `-race` to detect data races.
- Optimize with `-ldflags="-s -w"` to reduce binary size.

This ensures fast, portable binaries for backend Go applications.

## How do you implement custom marshalling for JSON?

**Custom JSON Marshalling in Go**

Custom JSON marshalling in Go allows structs to control their JSON serialization and deserialization.

**Implementation**:

- **Marshaler Interface**: Implement the `json.Marshaler` interface by defining a `MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error)` method:
  ```go title="Go"
  type User struct {
      Name string
      Age  int
  }
  func (u User) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error) {
      return json.Marshal(map[string]interface{}{
          "full_name": u.Name,
          "years":     u.Age,
      })
  }
  ```
- **Unmarshaler Interface**: Implement `json.Unmarshaler` with `UnmarshalJSON(data []byte) error` for deserialization:
  ```go title="Go"
  func (u *User) UnmarshalJSON(data []byte) error {
      aux := struct {
          FullName string `json:"full_name"`
          Years    int    `json:"years"`
      }{}
      if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &aux); err != nil {
          return err
      }
      u.Name, u.Age = aux.FullName, aux.Years
      return nil
  }
  ```

**Usage**:

- Use `json.Marshal` or `json.Unmarshal` as usual; custom methods are called automatically.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use for custom field names, formats, or omitting sensitive data.
- Avoid recursive calls to `json.Marshal` on the same type to prevent infinite loops.
- Test with `go test` to ensure correct serialization.
- Use `encoding/json` for standard JSON handling.

This ensures flexible JSON processing in Go backends.

## What is the difference between value and pointer receivers in methods?

**Value vs. Pointer Receivers**

Value and pointer receivers in Go methods determine how a method interacts with a type's data.

**Value Receivers**:

- Operate on a copy of the struct. Changes don’t affect the original.
- Syntax: `func (t Type) Method()`.
- Example:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Counter struct { Value int }
  func (c Counter) Increment() { c.Value++ } // Copy, no change to original
  ```
- Use for immutable operations or small structs to avoid allocation overhead.

**Pointer Receivers**:

- Operate on the original struct via a pointer. Changes persist.
- Syntax: `func (t *Type) Method()`.
- Example:
  ```go title="Go"
  func (c *Counter) Increment() { c.Value++ } // Modifies original
  ```
- Use for mutable operations or large structs to avoid copying.

**Key Differences**:

- Value receivers: Safe for concurrency, no side effects, but copying can be costly.
- Pointer receivers: Modify state, efficient for large structs, but require synchronization in concurrent code.
- Method sets: Value receivers work on both values and pointers; pointer receivers only work on pointers.

**Practical Notes**:

- Choose based on mutability needs and performance.
- Use `go vet` to catch misuse.
- Test with `-race` for concurrency safety.

This ensures efficient, correct method behavior in Go applications.

## Explain the stack and heap in Go.

**Stack and Heap in Go**

The stack and heap in Go manage memory allocation for variables in a program.

**Stack**:

- A per-goroutine memory region for short-lived variables, managed automatically.
- Stores function call frames, local variables, and parameters.
- Fast allocation/deallocation, no garbage collection needed.
- Example: `x := 42` in a function typically allocates `x` on the stack.

**Heap**:

- A shared memory region for variables with dynamic lifetimes or escaping scope.
- Managed by Go’s garbage collector, which reclaims unused memory.
- Variables escape to the heap if referenced outside their function (e.g., returned pointers, stored in globals).
- Example:
  ```go title="Go"
  func NewInt() *int {
      x := 42
      return &x // Escapes to heap
  }
  ```

**Key Differences**:

- Stack is faster, automatically reclaimed; heap is slower, garbage-collected.
- Escape analysis (`go build -gcflags="-m"`) determines stack vs. heap allocation.
- Stack allocation reduces GC pressure but is limited by stack size (dynamically grows per goroutine).

**Practical Notes**:

- Minimize heap allocations for performance using value types or sync.Pool.
- Profile with `pprof` to monitor heap usage.
- Test with `-race` to ensure concurrency safety.

This optimizes memory management in Go backends.

## What is stack growth in goroutines?

**Stack Growth in Goroutines**

Stack growth in Go refers to the dynamic resizing of a goroutine’s stack to accommodate its needs during execution.

**How It Works**:

- Each goroutine starts with a small stack (2 KB in recent Go versions).
- If a goroutine’s stack usage exceeds its current size (e.g., deep recursion or large local variables), the runtime triggers stack growth.
- The runtime allocates a new, larger stack (typically doubling the size), copies the existing stack content, and updates pointers.
- This process is transparent and handled by the Go runtime.

**Key Features**:

- **Efficient**: Small initial stacks minimize memory usage; growth occurs only when needed.
- **Contiguous Stacks**: Go uses contiguous memory for stacks, unlike segmented stacks in older versions, improving performance.
- **No Shrinkage**: Stacks don’t shrink after growing, but unused memory is reclaimed by the garbage collector.

**Practical Notes**:

- Monitor stack usage with `pprof` or `runtime.Stack` to detect excessive growth.
- Avoid deep recursion to minimize stack growth overhead.
- Use `runtime.NumGoroutine()` to track goroutine count, as many goroutines increase memory pressure.
- Test with `-race` for concurrency safety.

This ensures efficient memory management for concurrent Go applications.

## How does the scheduler preempt goroutines?

**Goroutine Preemption**

Goroutine preemption allows Go’s scheduler to interrupt long-running goroutines to ensure fair execution in concurrent programs.

**How It Works**:

- **Cooperative Preemption**: Before Go 1.14, goroutines yielded only at specific points (e.g., I/O, channel operations, `runtime.Gosched()`).
- **Signal-Based Preemption (Go 1.14+)**: The scheduler uses a timer-based mechanism to interrupt goroutines at safe points, like function calls or loops.
  - The runtime monitors goroutines via a global timer.
  - If a goroutine runs too long (e.g., >10ms), the scheduler sends a signal to pause it.
  - The runtime inserts preemption checks in compiled code (e.g., at function prologues).
- **Process**: The interrupted goroutine is parked (saved to a run queue), and another goroutine is scheduled on the same logical processor (P).

**Key Features**:

- Ensures fairness by preventing CPU-bound goroutines from monopolizing threads.
- Works with `GOMAXPROCS` to balance parallelism across CPUs.
- Transparent to developers; no explicit code changes needed.

**Practical Notes**:

- Profile with `pprof` to detect preemption issues in CPU-intensive tasks.
- Use `runtime.Gosched()` for explicit yielding in tight loops.
- Test with `-race` to ensure concurrency safety.

This enhances responsiveness in Go backend systems.

## What is work-stealing in Go scheduler?

**Work-Stealing in Go Scheduler**

Work-stealing is a scheduling strategy in Go’s runtime to balance goroutine execution across logical processors (Ps).

**Definition**:

- When a logical processor’s (P) run queue is empty, it “steals” goroutines from another P’s queue to maximize CPU utilization.

**How It Works**:

- Each P has a local run queue of goroutines, bound to an OS thread (M).
- If a P’s queue is empty, the scheduler attempts to steal half the goroutines from another P’s queue, chosen randomly to avoid contention.
- If local queues are empty, the scheduler checks the global run queue or creates new goroutines.
- Stealing occurs during scheduling events (e.g., after a goroutine yields or completes).

**Key Features**:

- Improves load balancing in concurrent programs, especially with varying workloads.
- Reduces idle time for Ps, enhancing throughput.
- Works with `GOMAXPROCS` to scale across CPU cores.

**Practical Notes**:

- Monitor with `pprof` to analyze scheduling efficiency.
- Ensure `GOMAXPROCS` is set appropriately (default: CPU cores).
- Test with `-race` to detect concurrency issues.
- Avoid excessive goroutines to minimize stealing overhead.

This ensures efficient resource use in Go backend applications.

## Explain read-write mutexes.

**Read-Write Mutexes**

`sync.RWMutex` in Go provides a read-write mutex for efficient concurrency control, allowing multiple readers or one writer to access shared resources safely.

**Definition**:

- A read-write mutex (`sync.RWMutex`) supports two lock types: read locks (shared) and write locks (exclusive).

**How It Works**:

- **Read Lock (`RLock`)**: Multiple goroutines can acquire read locks simultaneously, allowing concurrent reads of shared data.
  ```go title="Go"
  var mu sync.RWMutex
  mu.RLock()
  // Read shared data
  mu.RUnlock()
  ```
- **Write Lock (`Lock`)**: Only one goroutine can hold a write lock, blocking all readers and writers until `Unlock` is called.
  ```go title="Go"
  mu.Lock()
  // Modify shared data
  mu.Unlock()
  ```
- **Behavior**: Write locks have priority; pending writers block new readers to prevent starvation.

**Key Features**:

- Optimizes performance for read-heavy workloads by allowing concurrent reads.
- Ensures mutual exclusion for writes, maintaining data consistency.
- Not reentrant; the same goroutine cannot re-lock without unlocking.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use for resources with frequent reads and infrequent writes (e.g., caches).
- Avoid long-held locks to reduce contention.
- Test with `-race` to detect data races.
- Profile with `pprof` to optimize lock usage.

This enhances concurrency in Go backend applications.

## How do you use cond variables?

**Using Cond Variables**

`sync.Cond` in Go coordinates goroutines waiting for or signaling specific conditions in concurrent programs.

**Definition**:

- A condition variable (`sync.Cond`) synchronizes goroutines, allowing them to wait until a condition is met or signal when it changes.

**How It Works**:

- **Initialize**: Create with a mutex (`sync.Mutex` or `sync.RWMutex`):
  ```go title="Go"
  var mu sync.Mutex
  cond := sync.NewCond(&mu)
  ```
- **Wait**: Goroutines call `cond.Wait()` to block until signaled. It releases the mutex and re-acquires it upon waking:
  ```go title="Go"
  mu.Lock()
  for !condition {
      cond.Wait() // Blocks until signaled
  }
  mu.Unlock()
  ```
- **Signal/Broadcast**:
  - `cond.Signal()`: Wakes one waiting goroutine.
  - `cond.Broadcast()`: Wakes all waiting goroutines.
  ```go title="Go"
  mu.Lock()
  condition = true
  cond.Broadcast() // Notify all waiters
  mu.Unlock()
  ```

**Key Features**:

- Ensures synchronized access to shared state with the associated mutex.
- Ideal for scenarios like producer-consumer or resource availability.

**Practical Notes**:

- Always check conditions in a loop to avoid spurious wakeups.
- Use for complex synchronization not suited for channels.
- Test with `-race` to ensure thread safety.
- Profile with `pprof` to optimize performance.

This enhances coordination in Go backend systems.

## What are type sets in generics?

**Type Sets in Generics**

Type sets in Go generics define the collection of types a type parameter can represent, introduced in Go 1.18.

**Definition**:

- A type set is the set of types allowed by a constraint, typically an interface, for a generic type parameter.

**How It Works**:

- **Constraints**: Interfaces define type sets using methods or type terms. For example:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Number interface {
      int | float64 | int32
  }
  func Add[T Number](a, b T) T {
      return a + b
  }
  ```
  Here, `Number`’s type set is `{int, float64, int32}`.
- **Method Constraints**: Interfaces can include methods, restricting the type set to types implementing them:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Stringer interface {
      String() string
  }
  func Print[T Stringer](v T) { fmt.Println(v.String()) }
  ```
- **Type Inference**: The compiler ensures `T` belongs to the constraint’s type set, inferred from arguments (e.g., `Add(1, 2)` sets `T` to `int`).

**Key Features**:

- Enables type safety by restricting type parameters.
- Supports union types (`|`) and method-based constraints.
- `any` constraint allows all types.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use `constraints` package (e.g., `constraints.Ordered`) for common type sets.
- Keep constraints simple for readability.
- Verify with `go vet` for type safety.

This ensures flexible, safe generics in Go backends.

## How do you define interface constraints?

**Defining Interface Constraints**

Interface constraints in Go generics, introduced in Go 1.18, define the allowed types for type parameters by specifying a type set.

**Definition**:

- Interface constraints combine method requirements and type terms to restrict types for generics.

**How to Define**:

- **Basic Interface**: Use an interface with methods to constrain types:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Stringer interface {
      String() string
  }
  func Print[T Stringer](v T) { fmt.Println(v.String()) }
  ```
  Only types implementing `String()` are allowed.
- **Union Types**: Specify multiple types using `|`:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Number interface {
      int | float64 | int32
  }
  func Add[T Number](a, b T) T { return a + b }
  ```
  `T` is restricted to `int`, `float64`, or `int32`.
- **Combined Constraints**: Mix methods and types:
  ```go title="Go"
  type ComparableNumber interface {
      ~int | ~float64 // ~ allows derived types
      Less(other interface{}) bool
  }
  ```

**Key Features**:

- Type sets include all types satisfying the interface (methods or explicit types).
- `any` allows all types; `constraints.Ordered` supports comparable types.
- Type inference ensures `T` matches the constraint.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use `golang.org/x/exp/constraints` for predefined constraints.
- Keep constraints minimal for clarity.
- Verify with `go vet` for type safety.

This enables robust generic programming in Go backends.

## What is comparable constraint?

**Comparable Constraint**

The `comparable` constraint in Go generics, introduced in Go 1.18, restricts type parameters to types that support equality comparisons (`==` and `!=`).

**Definition**:

- `comparable` is a built-in constraint allowing types whose values can be compared for equality, such as integers, floats, strings, booleans, pointers, channels, and interfaces.

**How It Works**:

- Used in generic functions or types to ensure type safety for equality operations:
  ```go title="Go"
  func Contains[T comparable](slice []T, value T) bool {
      for _, v := range slice {
          if v == value {
              return true
          }
      }
      return false
  }
  ```
  Here, `T` must support `==` (e.g., `int`, `string`, but not slices or maps).

**Key Features**:

- Ensures compile-time safety for equality checks in generics.
- Excludes types like slices, maps, or functions, which can’t be compared.
- Works with structs if all fields are comparable.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use `comparable` for generic containers (e.g., sets, maps) or equality-based algorithms.
- Prefer `constraints.Ordered` from `golang.org/x/exp/constraints` for ordered types (`<`, `>`).
- Verify type safety with `go vet`.
- Test edge cases with `go test`.

This ensures robust equality operations in Go backend applications.

## How do you use any in generics?

**Using `any` in Generics**

The `any` constraint in Go generics, introduced in Go 1.18, allows a type parameter to accept any type, acting as an alias for `interface{}`.

**Definition**:

- `any` is a built-in constraint that imposes no restrictions on the type parameter, enabling maximum flexibility.

**How It Works**:

- Declare a generic function or type with `any` to allow any type for the parameter:
  ```go title="Go"
  func Print[T any](value T) {
      fmt.Println(value)
  }
  ```
  `T` can be any type (e.g., `int`, `string`, `struct`).
- Example with a generic struct:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Box[T any] struct {
      Value T
  }
  ```

**Usage**:

- Call with any type: `Print(42)`, `Print("hello")`, or `Box[string]{Value: "test"}`.
- Type inference automatically resolves `T` based on the argument.

**Key Features**:

- Replaces `interface{}` for cleaner, type-safe generic code.
- No method or type restrictions, unlike specific constraints like `comparable`.
- Useful for generic containers or utility functions.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use sparingly to avoid losing type safety; prefer specific constraints when possible.
- Combine with `go vet` to ensure correctness.
- Test with varied inputs using `go test`.

This enhances flexibility in Go backend generic programming.

## Explain runtime reflection limitations.

**Runtime Reflection Limitations**

Reflection in Go, provided by the `reflect` package, allows dynamic inspection and manipulation of types and values at runtime.

**Key Limitations**:

- **Performance Overhead**: Reflection is slower than static code due to runtime type checks and dynamic operations. Avoid in performance-critical paths.
- **Type Safety**: Reflection bypasses compile-time type checks, increasing the risk of runtime errors (e.g., invalid type assertions).
  ```go title="Go"
  v := reflect.ValueOf(42)
  if v.Kind() != reflect.String {
      // Runtime error if expecting string
  }
  ```
- **Limited Mutability**: Can’t modify unexported fields or immutable values (e.g., constants, non-addressable values).
- **No Method Creation**: Can’t dynamically create or modify methods on types.
- **Complexity**: Code using reflection is harder to read and maintain compared to static typing.
- **Interface Constraints**: In generics, reflection can’t directly access type parameter constraints or methods without additional checks.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use reflection for serialization (e.g., JSON), debugging, or dynamic dispatch when static alternatives are impractical.
- Prefer interfaces or generics for type-safe solutions.
- Profile with `pprof` to measure reflection overhead.
- Test with `go test` to catch runtime errors.

This ensures careful use of reflection in Go backend applications.

## How do you call C functions with cgo?

**Calling C Functions with cgo**

cgo enables Go programs to call C functions by generating glue code for interoperability.

**How It Works**:

- **Import C**: Use `import "C"` to access C functionality. Include C headers or code in comments:
  ```go title="Go"
  // #include <stdio.h>
  import "C"
  ```
- **Calling C Functions**: Invoke C functions using the `C` package:
  ```go title="Go"
  func PrintHello() {
      C.puts(C.CString("Hello from C"))
  }
  ```
- **Type Conversion**: Convert Go types to C types (e.g., `C.int` for `int`, `C.CString` for strings). Free C-allocated memory with `C.free`:
  ```go title="Go"
  str := C.CString("test")
  defer C.free(unsafe.Pointer(str))
  C.someFunction(str)
  ```

**Key Steps**:

- Write C code or include headers above `import "C"`.
- Use `// #cgo` for compiler flags (e.g., `// #cgo LDFLAGS: -lm`).
- Call C functions with `C.functionName(args)`.

**Practical Notes**:

- Ensure proper memory management to avoid leaks.
- Use `unsafe.Pointer` for complex C types cautiously.
- Enable cgo with `CGO_ENABLED=1` during build.
- Test with `-race` to detect concurrency issues.
- Profile with `pprof` to assess performance.

This enables seamless C integration in Go backend applications.

## What are cgo overheads?

**cgo Overheads**

cgo overheads are performance and complexity costs incurred when using cgo to call C code from Go.

**Key Overheads**:

- **Performance Cost**: cgo calls involve context switching between Go and C runtimes, which is slower than native Go calls. Each call crosses the Go-C boundary, adding latency.
- **Memory Management**: Go’s garbage collector doesn’t manage C-allocated memory. Manual management (e.g., `C.free` for `C.CString`) increases complexity and risks leaks.
  ```go title="Go"
  str := C.CString("test")
  defer C.free(unsafe.Pointer(str))
  ```
- **Build Complexity**: cgo requires a C compiler and linker, complicating cross-compilation and increasing build times. Set `CGO_ENABLED=1` explicitly.
- **Threading Overhead**: cgo calls lock an OS thread, limiting goroutine scheduling flexibility and increasing contention in concurrent programs.
- **Binary Size**: Including C libraries increases the size of the resulting binary.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use cgo only for essential C libraries or performance-critical code.
- Profile with `pprof` to quantify overhead.
- Test with `-race` to detect concurrency issues.
- Consider pure Go alternatives (e.g., `golang.org/x/sys`) to avoid cgo.
- Document cgo usage for maintainability.

This ensures efficient integration of C code in Go backends.

## How do you use block profiling?

**Block Profiling**

Block profiling in Go analyzes goroutine blocking events (e.g., mutex waits, channel operations) to identify contention bottlenecks.

**How It Works**:

- **Enable Profiling**: Use `runtime.SetBlockProfileRate` to set the sampling rate for blocking events (e.g., rate=1 for all events):

  ```go title="Go"
  import "runtime"

  func init() {
      runtime.SetBlockProfileRate(1)
  }
  ```

- **Collect Data**: Run the program. Blocking events are recorded in the runtime.
- **Access Profile**:
  - Use `net/http/pprof` to expose profiles via HTTP (`/debug/pprof/block`).
  - Alternatively, save manually with `pprof.WriteProfile("block.prof")`.
- **Analyze**: Use `go tool pprof block.prof` or `go tool pprof http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/block` for analysis.
  - Commands: `top` (show top blocking events), `web` (visualize), `list` (source details).

**Key Features**:

- Captures delays from mutexes, channels, or I/O operations.
- Helps optimize concurrency by pinpointing contention points.

**Practical Notes**:

- Set rate carefully; low values (e.g., 1) increase overhead but capture more data.
- Use in production-like environments for accurate results.
- Combine with `pprof` CPU/memory profiles for holistic analysis.
- Test with `-race` to ensure concurrency safety.

This improves performance in concurrent Go backend applications.

## What is allocation profiling?

**Allocation Profiling**

Allocation profiling in Go tracks memory allocations to identify and optimize memory usage in programs.

**Definition**:

- Allocation profiling records heap allocations made during program execution, helping pinpoint memory-intensive operations.

**How It Works**:

- **Enable Profiling**: Use `net/http/pprof` to expose allocation data via `/debug/pprof/allocs` or `runtime/pprof` for manual collection:

  ```go title="Go"
  import "net/http/pprof"

  func main() {
      go http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil) // Expose /debug/pprof/allocs
  }
  ```

- **Collect Data**: Run the program and fetch the profile with `curl http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/allocs > allocs.prof`.
- **Analyze**: Use `go tool pprof allocs.prof` to inspect allocation sites:
  - `top`: Lists functions with the most allocations.
  - `web`: Visualizes allocation graph.
  - `list`: Shows source code with allocation details.

**Key Features**:

- Tracks heap allocations, not stack (use `go build -gcflags="-m"` for escape analysis).
- Helps reduce garbage collection pressure by identifying allocation hotspots.

**Practical Notes**:

- Profile in production-like environments for accuracy.
- Combine with CPU profiling for comprehensive optimization.
- Use `sync.Pool` or value types to reduce allocations.
- Test with `-race` for concurrency safety.

This optimizes memory efficiency in Go backend applications.

## How do you analyze traces?

**Analyzing Traces**

Trace analysis in Go examines execution events (e.g., goroutine activity, syscalls) to diagnose performance issues in concurrent programs.

**How It Works**:

- **Collect Trace**: Use `runtime/trace` to capture trace data:
  ```go title="Go"
  import "runtime/trace"
  f, _ := os.Create("trace.out")
  trace.Start(f)
  defer trace.Stop()
  ```
- **Analyze Trace**: Run `go tool trace trace.out` to open a web-based UI.
  - **Timeline View**: Shows goroutine execution, scheduling, and blocking events over time.
  - **Goroutine Analysis**: Lists goroutines, their durations, and blocking reasons (e.g., I/O, mutex).
  - **Network/GC/Syscall Events**: Identifies delays from network, garbage collection, or system calls.

**Key Features**:

- Visualizes concurrency bottlenecks, like goroutine contention or long waits.
- Highlights garbage collection pauses and scheduling inefficiencies.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use in production-like environments for accurate data.
- Keep trace duration short to manage file size and overhead.
- Combine with `pprof` for CPU/memory insights.
- Focus on high-latency events to optimize backend performance.
- Test with `-race` to ensure concurrency safety.

This enables precise diagnosis of performance issues in Go applications.

## What is escape analysis optimization?

**Escape Analysis Optimization**

Escape analysis optimization in Go determines whether a variable should be allocated on the stack or heap to improve performance.

**Definition**:

- Escape analysis is a compiler process that identifies if a variable’s lifetime extends beyond its function scope, deciding its allocation.

**How It Works**:

- The Go compiler analyzes variable usage:
  - **Stack Allocation**: Variables that don’t escape (e.g., local variables not referenced externally) are allocated on the stack, which is fast and auto-reclaimed.
  - **Heap Allocation**: Variables that escape (e.g., returned pointers, stored in globals) are allocated on the heap, managed by the garbage collector.
  - Example:
    ```go title="Go"
    func NoEscape() int {
        x := 42 // Stays on stack
        return x
    }
    func Escape() *int {
        x := 42 // Escapes to heap
        return &x
    }
    ```

**Key Features**:

- Reduces heap allocations, lowering garbage collection overhead.
- Optimizes memory usage for concurrent programs.

**Practical Notes**:

- Inspect with `go build -gcflags="-m"` to see allocation decisions.
- Minimize escapes by using value types or avoiding unnecessary pointers.
- Profile with `pprof` to measure impact.
- Test with `-race` for concurrency safety.

This enhances performance in Go backend applications.

## How do you inline functions?

**Inlining Functions**

Inlining in Go is an optimization where the compiler replaces a function call with the function’s body to reduce call overhead.

**Definition**:

- Inlining embeds small function code directly at the call site, improving performance by eliminating function call overhead.

**How It Works**:

- The Go compiler automatically inlines small, simple functions during compilation based on heuristics (e.g., size, complexity).
- Example:
  ```go title="Go"
  func Add(a, b int) int {
      return a + b
  }
  func main() {
      x := Add(2, 3) // Likely inlined
  }
  ```
- The compiler may inline `Add` by replacing the call with `x := 2 + 3`.

**Key Features**:

- Improves performance for small, frequently called functions.
- Controlled by the compiler; no explicit keyword exists.
- Inlining may increase binary size due to code duplication.

**Practical Notes**:

- Write small, simple functions to encourage inlining.
- Check inlining decisions with `go build -gcflags="-m"`.
- Avoid complex logic or large functions, as they’re less likely to be inlined.
- Profile with `pprof` to verify performance gains.
- Test with `-race` to ensure concurrency safety.

This optimizes execution speed in Go backend applications.

## What is bounds check elimination?

**Bounds Check Elimination**

Bounds check elimination (BCE) in Go is a compiler optimization that removes redundant array or slice bounds checks to improve performance.

**Definition**:

- BCE eliminates runtime checks that ensure array/slice indices are within bounds, reducing overhead when the compiler proves the access is safe.

**How It Works**:

- The Go compiler analyzes code to identify safe index accesses:
  ```go title="Go"
  func Sum(slice []int) int {
      sum := 0
      for i := 0; i < len(slice); i++ {
          sum += slice[i] // Bounds check may be eliminated
      }
      return sum
  }
  ```
- The compiler recognizes `i` is always within `slice` bounds (0 to `len(slice)-1`), skipping the bounds check.

**Key Features**:

- Speeds up loops and array/slice operations by reducing runtime checks.
- Applied automatically during compilation for provably safe accesses.

**Practical Notes**:

- Write clear loops with predictable bounds to aid BCE.
- Check optimization with `go build -gcflags="-m"`.
- Avoid complex indexing that prevents BCE (e.g., dynamic or unprovable bounds).
- Profile with `pprof` to confirm performance gains.
- Test with `-race` for concurrency safety.

This enhances execution speed in performance-critical Go backend applications.

## How do you handle panics in production?

**Handling Panics in Production**

Panics in Go are unexpected errors that stop normal execution. Handling them in production ensures application stability.

**Key Strategies**:

- **Defer and Recover**: Use `defer` with `recover()` to catch panics and prevent crashes:
  ```go title="Go"
  func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      defer func() {
          if r := recover(); r != nil {
              log.Printf("Panic: %v", r)
              http.Error(w, "Internal Server Error", http.StatusInternalServerError)
          }
      }()
      // Handler logic
  }
  ```
- **Logging**: Log panic details (e.g., stack trace) using `logrus` or `runtime.Stack` for debugging.
- **Middleware**: Centralize panic recovery in HTTP middleware for web servers:
  ```go title="Go"
  func PanicMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
      return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
          defer func() {
              if r := recover(); r != nil {
                  log.Printf("Panic: %v", r)
                  http.Error(w, "Internal Error", 500)
              }
          }()
          next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
      })
  }
  ```
- **Graceful Recovery**: Return user-friendly errors and maintain system uptime.
- **Avoid Panics**: Use explicit error handling to prevent panics where possible.

**Practical Notes**:

- Monitor with tools like Prometheus to track panic frequency.
- Test recovery logic with `go test`.
- Use `-race` to detect concurrency issues.

This ensures robust Go backend applications.

## What is error chaining?

**Error Chaining**

Error chaining in Go links related errors to provide context, improving debugging in large applications.

**Definition**:

- Error chaining wraps errors with additional context, preserving the original error for inspection, introduced in Go 1.13.

**How It Works**:

- Use `fmt.Errorf` with the `%w` verb to wrap errors:
  ```go title="Go"
  func process() error {
      err := errors.New("database error")
      return fmt.Errorf("process failed: %w", err)
  }
  ```
- **Unwrapping**: Access the underlying error with `errors.Unwrap` or check with `errors.Is` and `errors.As`:
  ```go title="Go"
  err := process()
  if errors.Is(err, errors.New("database error")) {
      fmt.Println("Found database error")
  }
  ```
- **Custom Wrapping**: Use `github.com/pkg/errors` for richer context:
  ```go title="Go"
  return errors.Wrap(err, "process failed")
  ```

**Key Features**:

- Maintains error hierarchy for detailed debugging.
- `errors.Is` checks if a specific error is in the chain.
- `errors.As` extracts errors of a specific type.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use in large systems to trace error origins.
- Log wrapped errors with `logrus` for clarity.
- Test error paths with `go test` to ensure proper chaining.
- Avoid over-wrapping to keep messages clear.

This enhances error handling in Go backend applications.

## How do you trace requests with context?

**Tracing Requests with Context**

Tracing requests with `context` in Go tracks request flow across distributed systems for debugging and monitoring.

**Definition**:

- The `context` package propagates request-scoped data, like trace IDs, across goroutines and services.

**How It Works**:

- **Create Context**: Initialize with a trace ID using `context.WithValue`:
  ```go title="Go"
  ctx := context.WithValue(context.Background(), "traceID", "12345")
  ```
- **Propagate Context**: Pass `ctx` through function calls or API requests (e.g., HTTP headers, gRPC metadata):
  ```go title="Go"
  req := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, "GET", url, nil)
  req.Header.Set("X-Trace-ID", ctx.Value("traceID").(string))
  ```
- **Extract Context**: Retrieve trace ID in handlers or services:
  ```go title="Go"
  func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      ctx := r.Context()
      traceID := ctx.Value("traceID").(string)
      log.Printf("Trace ID: %s", traceID)
  }
  ```
- **Distributed Tracing**: Use tools like OpenTelemetry or Jaeger to propagate trace IDs across services.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use structured logging (e.g., `logrus`) to include trace IDs.
- Avoid excessive `context.Value` usage; prefer explicit parameters for clarity.
- Test with `go test` to verify context propagation.
- Integrate with monitoring tools for end-to-end tracing.

This enhances observability in Go backend systems.

## Explain token buckets for rate limiting.

**Token Buckets for Rate Limiting**

Token bucket is a rate-limiting algorithm that controls request frequency in Go applications to prevent system overload.

**Definition**:

- A token bucket holds a fixed number of tokens, refilled at a constant rate. Requests consume tokens, and if none are available, they’re blocked or rejected.

**How It Works**:

- **Bucket Setup**: Define capacity (burst size) and refill rate. For example, 10 tokens with a refill of 1 token/second.
- **Consumption**: Each request consumes one token. If tokens are available, the request proceeds; otherwise, it waits or fails.
- **Implementation**: Use `golang.org/x/time/rate`:
  ```go title="Go"
  limiter := rate.NewLimiter(rate.Limit(1), 10) // 1 req/s, burst of 10
  func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      if limiter.Allow() {
          // Process request
      } else {
          http.Error(w, "Rate limit exceeded", http.StatusTooManyRequests)
      }
  }
  ```

**Key Features**:

- Supports bursty traffic up to the bucket’s capacity.
- Refills tokens smoothly over time.

**Practical Notes**:

- Tune rate and burst based on load tests.
- Use in middleware for HTTP servers.
- Log rejections with `logrus` for monitoring.
- Test with tools like `wrk` to verify limits.

This ensures scalable rate limiting in Go backends.

## How do you implement gRPC servers?

**Implementing gRPC Servers**

gRPC servers in Go handle remote procedure calls using HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers for efficient, type-safe communication.

**Steps**:

- **Define Service**: Create a `.proto` file with service and message definitions:
  ```proto
  service Greeter {
      rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
  }
  message HelloRequest { string name = 1; }
  message HelloReply { string message = 1; }
  ```
- **Generate Code**: Run `protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. service.proto` to generate Go stubs.
- **Implement Server**:
  ```go title="Go"
  type server struct {
      pb.UnimplementedGreeterServer
  }
  func (s *server) SayHello(ctx context.Context, req *pb.HelloRequest) (*pb.HelloReply, error) {
      return &pb.HelloReply{Message: "Hello, " + req.Name}, nil
  }
  func main() {
      lis, _ := net.Listen("tcp", ":50051")
      s := grpc.NewServer()
      pb.RegisterGreeterServer(s, &server{})
      s.Serve(lis)
  }
  ```

**Key Features**:

- Uses `grpc.NewServer()` for server setup.
- Supports streaming and bidirectional RPCs.
- Integrates with `context` for timeouts/cancellation.

**Practical Notes**:

- Add middleware for logging or authentication.
- Use TLS for secure communication.
- Test with `grpcurl` or clients.
- Monitor with `pprof` for performance.

This enables scalable, efficient microservices in Go backends.

## What is protobuf compilation?

**Protobuf Compilation**

Protobuf compilation in Go converts `.proto` files into Go code for type-safe serialization and communication.

**Definition**:

- Protobuf compilation uses the `protoc` compiler to generate Go structs and methods from Protocol Buffers schema definitions.

**How It Works**:

- **Define Schema**: Create a `.proto` file with message or service definitions:
  ```proto
  message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
  }
  ```
- **Compile**: Run `protoc --go_out=. file.proto` to generate Go code. For gRPC, use `protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. file.proto`.
- **Generated Code**: Produces structs with fields matching the schema and methods for serialization/deserialization:
  ```go title="Go"
  p := &pb.Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}
  data, _ := proto.Marshal(p) // Serialize
  ```

**Key Features**:

- Generates type-safe structs and interfaces.
- Supports efficient binary serialization.
- Enables gRPC service implementations.

**Practical Notes**:

- Install `protoc` and `github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go`.
- Use consistent versioning to avoid schema conflicts.
- Validate schemas with `protoc --lint`.
- Test generated code with `go test`.

This ensures efficient data handling and communication in Go backend applications.

## How do you use JWT in Go?

**Using JWT in Go**

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in Go authenticate users by issuing and verifying signed tokens for secure API access.

**Implementation**:

- **Library**: Use `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5` for JWT handling.
- **Create Token**:

  ```go title="Go"
  import "github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5"

  func CreateToken(userID string) (string, error) {
      token := jwt.NewWithClaims(jwt.SigningMethodHS256, jwt.MapClaims{
          "sub": userID,
          "exp": time.Now().Add(time.Hour * 24).Unix(),
      })
      return token.SignedString([]byte("secret"))
  }
  ```

- **Verify Token**:
  ```go title="Go"
  func VerifyToken(tokenStr string) (*jwt.Token, error) {
      return jwt.Parse(tokenStr, func(token *jwt.Token) (interface{}, error) {
          return []byte("secret"), nil
      })
  }
  ```
- **Middleware**:
  ```go title="Go"
  func AuthMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
      return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
          tokenStr := r.Header.Get("Authorization")
          token, err := VerifyToken(tokenStr)
          if err != nil || !token.Valid {
              http.Error(w, "Unauthorized", http.StatusUnauthorized)
              return
          }
          next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
      })
  }
  ```

**Practical Notes**:

- Store secrets securely (e.g., environment variables).
- Use HTTPS to protect tokens.
- Validate claims (e.g., `exp`) to ensure token validity.
- Test with `go test` for security.

This secures Go backend APIs effectively.

## What is OAuth2 in Go?

**OAuth2 in Go**

OAuth2 is an authorization framework allowing third-party applications to access resources on behalf of a user, commonly used for secure API authentication.

**Definition**:

- OAuth2 enables users to grant access to their data (e.g., Google, GitHub) without sharing credentials, using access tokens.

**Implementation in Go**:

- **Library**: Use `golang.org/x/oauth2` for OAuth2 flows.
- **Configuration**:

  ```go title="Go"
  import "golang.org/x/oauth2"

  config := &oauth2.Config{
      ClientID:     "your-client-id",
      ClientSecret: "your-client-secret",
      RedirectURL:  "http://localhost:8080/callback",
      Scopes:       []string{"email", "profile"},
      Endpoint:     oauth2.Endpoint{
          AuthURL:  "https://provider.com/oauth2/auth",
          TokenURL: "https://provider.com/oauth2/token",
      },
  }
  ```

- **Authorization**:
  - Redirect user to `config.AuthCodeURL("state")`.
  - Handle callback to exchange code for token:
    ```go title="Go"
    http.HandleFunc("/callback", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        code := r.URL.Query().Get("code")
        token, _ := config.Exchange(context.Background(), code)
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Token: %s", token.AccessToken)
    })
    ```

**Practical Notes**:

- Use provider-specific endpoints (e.g., `google.Endpoint`).
- Store tokens securely (e.g., encrypted database).
- Use HTTPS to protect data.
- Test with `go test` to verify flows.

This enables secure third-party authentication in Go backends.

## How do you handle websocket connections?

**Handling WebSocket Connections**

WebSocket connections in Go enable real-time, bidirectional communication between client and server.

**Implementation**:

- **Library**: Use `github.com/gorilla/websocket` for WebSocket support.
- **Upgrade Connection**:

  ```go title="Go"
  import "github.com/gorilla/websocket"

  var upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{
      CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool { return true },
  }

  func handleWS(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      conn, _ := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)
      defer conn.Close()
      for {
          msgType, msg, err := conn.ReadMessage()
          if err != nil {
              log.Printf("Error: %v", err)
              return
          }
          conn.WriteMessage(msgType, msg) // Echo message
      }
  }
  ```

- **Server Setup**:
  ```go title="Go"
  func main() {
      http.HandleFunc("/ws", handleWS)
      http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
  }
  ```

**Key Features**:

- **Error Handling**: Check for read/write errors to detect closed connections.
- **Heartbeats**: Send periodic pings (`conn.WriteControl`) to maintain connections.
- **Concurrency**: Use goroutines for reading/writing to handle multiple clients.

**Practical Notes**:

- Secure with TLS (`wss://`) using `http.ListenAndServeTLS`.
- Validate `CheckOrigin` to prevent unauthorized access.
- Use `context` for cancellation.
- Test with `wscat` or browser clients.
- Monitor with `pprof` for performance.

This ensures reliable real-time communication in Go backends.

## Explain concurrent command execution.

**Concurrent Command Execution**

Concurrent command execution in Go runs multiple external commands simultaneously using goroutines and the `os/exec` package.

**How It Works**:

- **Setup Commands**: Create commands with `exec.Command`:
  ```go title="Go"
  cmds := []*exec.Cmd{
      exec.Command("ls", "-l"),
      exec.Command("echo", "hello"),
  }
  ```
- **Run Concurrently**: Launch each command in a goroutine, capturing output or errors:
  ```go title="Go"
  var wg sync.WaitGroup
  for _, cmd := range cmds {
      wg.Add(1)
      go func(c *exec.Cmd) {
          defer wg.Done()
          out, err := c.Output()
          if err != nil {
              log.Printf("Error: %v", err)
              return
          }
          fmt.Println(string(out))
      }(cmd)
  }
  wg.Wait()
  ```
- **Context Control**: Use `exec.CommandContext` for cancellation or timeouts:
  ```go title="Go"
  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
  defer cancel()
  cmd := exec.CommandContext(ctx, "sleep", "10")
  cmd.Run()
  ```

**Key Features**:

- Goroutines enable parallel execution, improving throughput.
- `sync.WaitGroup` synchronizes completion.
- Context manages timeouts and cancellations.

**Practical Notes**:

- Sanitize inputs to prevent command injection.
- Handle errors explicitly to avoid silent failures.
- Test with `-race` to detect concurrency issues.
- Profile with `pprof` for performance.

This ensures efficient, safe command execution in Go backends.

## How do you pipeline stages with channels?

**Pipelining Stages with Channels**

Pipelining stages with channels in Go processes data through sequential stages, each running in a goroutine, connected by channels for concurrency.

**How It Works**:

- **Define Stages**: Create functions for each stage, passing data via channels:
  ```go title="Go"
  func generate(ch chan<- int) {
      for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
          ch <- i
      }
      close(ch)
  }
  func square(in <-chan int, out chan<- int) {
      for n := range in {
          out <- n * n
      }
      close(out)
  }
  ```
- **Connect Stages**: Launch stages in goroutines, linking with channels:
  ```go title="Go"
  func main() {
      ch1 := make(chan int)
      ch2 := make(chan int)
      go generate(ch1)
      go square(ch1, ch2)
      for n := range ch2 {
          fmt.Println(n)
      }
  }
  ```

**Key Features**:

- Channels ensure synchronized, safe data transfer.
- Closing channels signals stage completion.
- Supports fan-out (multiple workers) and fan-in (merging results).

**Practical Notes**:

- Use buffered channels (`make(chan T, n)`) to reduce blocking.
- Add `context` for cancellation.
- Test with `-race` to detect data races.
- Profile with `pprof` to optimize performance.

This enables scalable, concurrent data processing in Go backends.

## What is fuzzing with go test -fuzz?

**Fuzzing with `go test -fuzz`**

Fuzzing with `go test -fuzz` in Go automatically tests functions with random inputs to uncover bugs and edge cases, introduced in Go 1.18.

**Definition**:

- Fuzzing generates and tests random or mutated inputs to identify crashes, panics, or unexpected behavior.

**How It Works**:

- **Write Fuzz Test**: Define a fuzz test with `Fuzz` prefix:
  ```go title="Go"
  func FuzzParse(f *testing.F) {
      f.Add("123") // Seed initial input
      f.Fuzz(func(t *testing.T, s string) {
          _, err := strconv.Atoi(s)
          if err != nil {
              t.Skip() // Ignore invalid inputs
          }
      })
  }
  ```
- **Run Fuzzing**: Execute with `go test -fuzz=FuzzParse` to generate random inputs.
- **Results**: Fuzzing continues until a failure is found, saving failing inputs in `testdata/fuzz`.

**Key Features**:

- Automatically mutates inputs to explore edge cases.
- Seeds guide initial inputs with `f.Add`.
- Integrates with `go test` for easy use.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use for parsing, validation, or critical logic.
- Limit duration with `-fuzztime` (e.g., `-fuzztime 10s`).
- Review failing inputs to fix bugs.
- Combine with unit tests for robust coverage.

This enhances reliability in Go backend applications.

## How do you prevent SQL injection?

**Preventing SQL Injection**

SQL injection is prevented in Go by avoiding dynamic query construction and using safe database practices.

**Key Practices**:

- **Use Prepared Statements**: Leverage parameterized queries with `database/sql`:
  ```go title="Go"
  db, _ := sql.Open("mysql", "user:pass@/db")
  stmt, _ := db.Prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?")
  rows, _ := stmt.Query(1) // Safe, no injection
  ```
- **ORM with Parameterization**: Use ORMs like `GORM` that sanitize inputs:
  ```go title="Go"
  var user User
  db.Where("name = ?", name).First(&user) // Parameterized
  ```
- **Avoid String Concatenation**: Never build queries with raw user input:
  ```go title="Go"
  // Unsafe
  query := "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + name + "'"
  ```
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate user inputs (e.g., using `validator` package) before query use.
- **Escape Special Characters**: If manual escaping is needed, use database-specific escape functions (rarely required).

**Practical Notes**:

- Use `database/sql` or trusted ORMs for automatic parameterization.
- Test queries with `go test` to ensure safety.
- Log suspicious inputs with `logrus` for monitoring.
- Audit with tools like `gosec` to detect vulnerabilities.

This ensures secure database interactions in Go backends.

## What is HTTP/2 in Go?

**HTTP/2 in Go**

HTTP/2 is a protocol enhancing HTTP with features like multiplexing and header compression for faster, efficient web communication.

**Definition**:

- HTTP/2, supported natively in Go via the `net/http` package since Go 1.6, improves performance over HTTP/1.1 by reducing latency and enabling concurrent streams.

**How It Works**:

- **Enable HTTP/2**: Use `http.ListenAndServeTLS` for automatic HTTP/2 support with TLS:
  ```go title="Go"
  http.ListenAndServeTLS(":443", "cert.pem", "key.pem", nil)
  ```
- **Key Features**:
  - **Multiplexing**: Multiple requests/responses over a single TCP connection.
  - **Header Compression**: Reduces overhead using HPACK.
  - **Server Push**: Proactively sends resources (e.g., CSS) to clients:
    ```go title="Go"
    func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        if p, ok := w.(http.Pusher); ok {
            p.Push("/style.css", nil)
        }
    }
    ```
- **Configuration**: Use `golang.org/x/net/http2` for advanced settings, like custom TLS configs.

**Practical Notes**:

- Requires TLS; configure with valid certificates.
- Enable with `http2.ConfigureServer` for custom servers.
- Test with `curl --http2` or browser dev tools.
- Profile with `pprof` to optimize performance.

This enhances speed and scalability in Go web applications.

## How do you use module mirrors?

**Using Module Mirrors**

Module mirrors in Go cache module source code and metadata, improving dependency resolution speed and reliability.

**Definition**:

- Module mirrors are proxy servers (e.g., `proxy.golang.org`) that store Go module data, reducing direct repository access.

**How to Use**:

- **Configure Proxy**: Set the `GOPROXY` environment variable:

  ```bash
  export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
  ```

  - `direct` falls back to the source repository if the proxy fails.

- **Fetch Modules**: Run `go get`, `go build`, or `go mod download` to fetch modules via the proxy:
  ```go title="Go"
  go get github.com/example/module
  ```
- **Private Mirrors**: Use tools like JFrog Artifactory or Athens for internal mirrors:
  ```bash
  export GOPROXY=https://my-mirror.example.com
  ```
- **Verify Integrity**: Use `GOSUMDB` (default: `sum.golang.org`) to check module checksums:
  ```bash
  export GOSUMDB=sum.golang.org
  ```

**Practical Notes**:

- Use `go mod verify` to validate cached modules.
- Set `GOPRIVATE` for private modules to bypass public proxies:
  ```bash
  export GOPRIVATE=*.internal.company.com
  ```
- Test with `go list -m all` to ensure correct resolution.
- Monitor proxy performance with build logs.

This ensures fast, secure dependency management in Go backends.

## Explain the linker in Go build.

**Go Linker**

The Go linker combines object code, runtime, and dependencies into a single executable during the build process.

**Definition**:

- The linker, part of the `go build` process, resolves references, links libraries, and generates a platform-specific binary.

**How It Works**:

- **Input**: Takes object files from compiled Go code (produced by `gc` compiler) and runtime code.
- **Symbol Resolution**: Maps function and variable references to their definitions across packages.
- **Library Linking**: Includes standard library or external C libraries (via cgo) as needed.
- **Output**: Produces a standalone executable for the target platform (`GOOS`, `GOARCH`).
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  go build -o myapp main.go
  ```
  The linker creates `myapp` by combining compiled code and runtime.

**Key Features**:

- Produces self-contained binaries, including the Go runtime.
- Supports cross-compilation (e.g., `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build`).
- Optimizes with flags like `-ldflags="-s -w"` to strip debug info and reduce size.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use `-ldflags` for customizations (e.g., embedding version info).
- Check binary size with `ls -lh` and optimize if needed.
- Test with `-race` for concurrency safety.
- Profile with `pprof` to analyze linked binary performance.

This ensures efficient, portable executables in Go backends.

## What is custom JSON unmarshaler?

**Custom JSON Unmarshaler**

A custom JSON unmarshaler in Go allows a type to control its JSON deserialization by implementing the `json.Unmarshaler` interface.

**Definition**:

- The `json.Unmarshaler` interface defines an `UnmarshalJSON(data []byte) error` method to customize how JSON data is converted into a Go type.

**How It Works**:

- Implement `UnmarshalJSON` for a struct to handle custom deserialization logic:
  ```go title="Go"
  type User struct {
      Name string
      Age  int
  }
  func (u *User) UnmarshalJSON(data []byte) error {
      type Alias User // Avoid recursion
      aux := struct {
          FullName string `json:"full_name"`
          Years    int    `json:"years"`
      }{}
      if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &aux); err != nil {
          return err
      }
      u.Name, u.Age = aux.FullName, aux.Years
      return nil
  }
  ```
- Use with `json.Unmarshal`:
  ```go title="Go"
  var u User
  json.Unmarshal([]byte(`{"full_name":"Alice","years":30}`), &u)
  ```

**Key Features**:

- Enables custom field mapping or validation during deserialization.
- Works with any JSON structure, not just struct fields.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use to handle non-standard JSON formats or legacy APIs.
- Avoid recursive `json.Unmarshal` calls on the same type.
- Test with `go test` to verify correctness.
- Profile with `pprof` for performance.

This ensures flexible JSON handling in Go backends.

## How do you handle cyclic dependencies?

**Handling Cyclic Dependencies**

Cyclic dependencies occur when Go packages import each other, causing compilation errors.

**Definition**:

- A cyclic dependency is when package A imports package B, and B directly or indirectly imports A.

**Solutions**:

- **Refactor Packages**: Break the cycle by moving shared functionality to a new package:
  ```go title="Go"
  // Before: package A imports B, B imports A
  // After: Move shared types/functions to package C
  import "newpackageC"
  ```
- **Interfaces**: Define an interface in one package to decouple dependencies:
  ```go title="Go"
  // In package A
  type Service interface {
      DoSomething()
  }
  // Package B uses Service without importing A
  ```
- **Dependency Injection**: Pass dependencies explicitly to avoid direct imports:
  ```go title="Go"
  func NewB(s Service) *B { return &B{service: s} }
  ```
- **Merge Packages**: Combine tightly coupled packages into one if separation isn’t justified.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use `go mod graph` to detect cycles.
- Restructure code to ensure one-way dependencies.
- Test with `go build` to verify resolution.
- Document package boundaries to prevent future cycles.

This ensures clean, maintainable package structures in Go backends.

## What is interface satisfaction at compile time?

**Interface Satisfaction at Compile Time**

Interface satisfaction at compile time in Go ensures a type implements an interface’s methods before the program runs.

**Definition**:

- A type satisfies an interface if it defines all the interface’s methods with matching signatures, verified statically by the compiler.

**How It Works**:

- **Interface Definition**: Declare an interface with required methods:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Stringer interface {
      String() string
  }
  ```
- **Type Implementation**: A type satisfies the interface implicitly by implementing its methods:
  ```go title="Go"
  type User struct{ Name string }
  func (u User) String() string { return u.Name }
  ```
- **Compile-Time Check**: The compiler checks if a type satisfies an interface when assigned or used as that interface:
  ```go title="Go"
  var s Stringer = User{Name: "Alice"} // Compiler verifies User satisfies Stringer
  ```
- **Error Detection**: If methods are missing or mismatched, the compiler reports an error.

**Key Features**:

- Implicit implementation; no explicit “implements” keyword needed.
- Ensures type safety before runtime, preventing runtime errors.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use `go vet` to catch interface-related issues.
- Keep interfaces small for flexibility.
- Test with `go test` to verify implementations.
- Use for polymorphism in generic or modular Go backends.

This ensures robust, type-safe code in Go applications.

## Explain method sets.

**Method Sets**

Method sets in Go define the methods available for a type, determining how it can be used with interfaces or as a receiver.

**Definition**:

- A method set is the collection of methods defined for a type, either with value or pointer receivers.

**How It Works**:

- **Value Receiver**: Methods with value receivers (`func (t Type) Method()`) are in the method set of both the type and its pointer:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Counter struct{ Value int }
  func (c Counter) Inc() { c.Value++ } // Value receiver
  var c Counter
  c.Inc()        // Works
  (&c).Inc()     // Works
  ```
- **Pointer Receiver**: Methods with pointer receivers (`func (t *Type) Method()`) are only in the method set of the pointer type:
  ```go title="Go"
  func (c *Counter) Dec() { c.Value-- } // Pointer receiver
  (&c).Dec()     // Works
  // c.Dec()     // Fails: c is not *Counter
  ```
- **Interface Satisfaction**: A type satisfies an interface if its method set includes all interface methods.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use value receivers for immutability, pointer receivers for mutability.
- Check method sets with `go vet` for interface compliance.
- Test with `go test` to ensure behavior.

This ensures flexible, type-safe method usage in Go backends.

## How do you embed interfaces?

**Embedding Interfaces**

Embedding interfaces in Go combines multiple interfaces into a single interface, promoting code reuse and modularity.

**Definition**:

- Interface embedding includes one or more interfaces within another, creating a new interface with all methods from the embedded interfaces.

**How It Works**:

- **Define Interfaces**: Declare interfaces with methods:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Reader interface {
      Read() string
  }
  type Writer interface {
      Write(string)
  }
  ```
- **Embed Interfaces**: Combine them into a new interface:
  ```go title="Go"
  type ReadWriter interface {
      Reader
      Writer
  }
  ```
- **Implementation**: A type satisfies `ReadWriter` if it implements both `Read()` and `Write(string)`:
  ```go title="Go"
  type File struct{ data string }
  func (f *File) Read() string      { return f.data }
  func (f *File) Write(s string)    { f.data = s }
  var rw ReadWriter = &File{} // Satisfies ReadWriter
  ```

**Key Features**:

- Combines method sets of embedded interfaces.
- Implicitly requires all methods from embedded interfaces.
- Supports clean, reusable interface definitions.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use for modular designs (e.g., combining `io.Reader` and `io.Writer`).
- Verify satisfaction with `go vet`.
- Test implementations with `go test`.
- Avoid over-embedding to keep interfaces simple.

This enhances type safety and flexibility in Go backends.

## What is the nil interface?

**Nil Interface**

A nil interface in Go is an interface value that has no underlying type or value, represented as `nil`.

**Definition**:

- An interface value is a tuple of a type and a value. A nil interface has both type and value set to `nil`.

**How It Works**:

- **Declaration**: An interface is `nil` when not assigned a concrete type:
  ```go title="Go"
  var i interface{}
  fmt.Println(i == nil) // true
  ```
- **Assignment**: Assigning a `nil` concrete type to an interface makes it non-nil:
  ```go title="Go"
  var s *string
  i = s
  fmt.Println(i == nil) // false, has type *string
  ```
- **Behavior**: A nil interface causes a runtime panic if a method is called, but checking `== nil` is safe.

**Key Features**:

- Distinguished from a non-nil interface with a nil value (e.g., `i = (*string)(nil)`).
- Common in error handling (e.g., `error` interface).

**Practical Notes**:

- Check for `nil` explicitly before calling methods.
- Use `reflect` to inspect type/value if needed: `reflect.ValueOf(i).IsNil()`.
- Test with `go test` to handle edge cases.
- Avoid assuming interface `nil` means no underlying type.

This ensures safe interface handling in Go backends.

## How do you avoid interface boxing?

**Avoiding Interface Boxing**

Interface boxing in Go occurs when a value is wrapped in an interface, incurring memory allocation and performance overhead.

**Definition**:

- Boxing happens when a concrete type is assigned to an interface, creating a runtime tuple (type, value) on the heap.

**How to Avoid**:

- **Use Concrete Types**: Prefer concrete types over interfaces when the type is known:
  ```go title="Go"
  func Process(s string) {} // Avoid interface{}
  ```
- **Generics**: Use generics (Go 1.18+) to maintain type safety without interfaces:
  ```go title="Go"
  func Process[T any](v T) {} // No boxing
  ```
- **Value Receivers**: Use value receivers for small types to avoid heap allocation:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Counter struct{ n int }
  func (c Counter) Inc() { c.n++ } // No boxing
  ```
- **Avoid Unnecessary Interfaces**: Minimize `interface{}` or broad interfaces; use specific interfaces with minimal methods.
- **Escape Analysis**: Check with `go build -gcflags="-m"` to ensure variables stay on the stack:
  ```go title="Go"
  func NoBox() {
      var x int = 42 // Stays on stack
  }
  ```

**Practical Notes**:

- Profile with `pprof` to detect boxing overhead.
- Test with `-race` for concurrency safety.
- Use `go vet` to catch unnecessary interface usage.

This reduces allocations and improves performance in Go backends.

## Explain atomic.Value.

**atomic.Value**

`atomic.Value` in Go provides a thread-safe way to store and retrieve values atomically without locks.

**Definition**:

- `atomic.Value` is a type in the `sync/atomic` package that allows safe concurrent access to a single value of any type.

**How It Works**:

- **Store**: Sets a value atomically using `Store(v interface{})`:
  ```go title="Go"
  var v atomic.Value
  v.Store(42) // Store an int
  ```
- **Load**: Retrieves the value atomically using `Load() interface{}`:
  ```go title="Go"
  val := v.Load() // Returns 42
  ```
- **Type Consistency**: All stored values must be of the same concrete type, or a panic occurs:
  ```go title="Go"
  v.Store("string") // Panic: inconsistent type
  ```

**Key Features**:

- Lock-free, using atomic operations for concurrency.
- Ideal for read-heavy scenarios (e.g., configuration updates).
- No modification of the stored value; only replacement.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use for immutable or infrequently updated values (e.g., cached configs).
- Avoid for complex types requiring modification; use `sync.RWMutex` instead.
- Test with `-race` to ensure thread safety.
- Profile with `pprof` to assess performance impact.

This ensures safe, efficient value sharing in concurrent Go backends.

## How do you implement lock-free data structures?

**Implementing Lock-Free Data Structures**

Lock-free data structures in Go enable concurrent access without mutexes, using atomic operations for thread safety.

**Definition**:

- Lock-free data structures rely on `sync/atomic` primitives to manage concurrent updates, avoiding locks to reduce contention.

**How It Works**:

- **Atomic Operations**: Use `sync/atomic` for operations like `CompareAndSwap`, `Add`, or `Load`:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Counter struct {
      value int64
  }
  func (c *Counter) Increment() {
      atomic.AddInt64(&c.value, 1)
  }
  func (c *Counter) Value() int64 {
      return atomic.LoadInt64(&c.value)
  }
  ```
- **Compare-and-Swap (CAS)**: Update values only if unchanged, ensuring atomicity:
  ```go title="Go"
  func (c *Counter) CompareAndSwap(old, new int64) bool {
      return atomic.CompareAndSwapInt64(&c.value, old, new)
  }
  ```
- **Structures**: Implement lock-free queues or stacks using CAS loops for operations like push/pop.

**Key Features**:

- Reduces contention compared to mutexes.
- Guarantees progress for some goroutines, avoiding deadlocks.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use for simple, high-concurrency scenarios (e.g., counters, flags).
- Avoid complex logic; CAS loops can be tricky.
- Test with `-race` to ensure thread safety.
- Profile with `pprof` to verify performance gains.

This enhances concurrency in Go backend applications.

## What is the memory barrier?

**Memory Barrier**

A memory barrier in Go ensures consistent memory access ordering in concurrent programs, preventing reordering of operations that could cause data races.

**Definition**:

- A memory barrier is a synchronization mechanism that enforces a specific order of memory operations, ensuring visibility across goroutines.

**How It Works**:

- Go’s memory model guarantees that certain operations (e.g., atomic operations, channel sends/receives) act as implicit memory barriers.
- **Atomic Operations**: Using `sync/atomic` (e.g., `atomic.StoreInt64`, `atomic.LoadInt64`) ensures that memory updates are visible to other goroutines:
  ```go title="Go"
  var x int64
  func update() {
      atomic.StoreInt64(&x, 42) // Write with barrier
  }
  func read() int64 {
      return atomic.LoadInt64(&x) // Read with barrier
  }
  ```
- **Channel Operations**: Sending or receiving on a channel ensures prior writes are visible before the operation completes.
- **Mutexes**: Locking/unlocking (`sync.Mutex`, `sync.RWMutex`) provides memory barriers.

**Key Features**:

- Prevents compiler and CPU from reordering operations across barriers.
- Ensures data consistency in concurrent environments.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use `sync/atomic` for lock-free operations requiring barriers.
- Rely on channels or mutexes for most concurrency needs.
- Test with `-race` to detect data races.
- Profile with `pprof` to assess performance.

This ensures safe concurrency in Go backends.

## How do you use runtime.GC?

**Using runtime.GC**

`runtime.GC` in Go triggers a manual garbage collection cycle to reclaim unused memory.

**Definition**:

- `runtime.GC()` forces the Go runtime to perform a garbage collection, freeing memory allocated to unreachable objects.

**How It Works**:

- **Call**: Invoke directly to initiate garbage collection:

  ```go title="Go"
  import "runtime"

  func main() {
      runtime.GC() // Trigger GC
  }
  ```

- **Behavior**: Runs a mark-and-sweep cycle, identifying and freeing heap memory no longer referenced.
- **Use Case**: Useful in memory-intensive applications or before memory profiling to ensure consistent state.

**Key Features**:

- Forces immediate garbage collection, unlike the runtime’s automatic scheduling.
- Can reduce memory usage in specific scenarios (e.g., after large object deallocation).

**Practical Notes**:

- Avoid frequent use; automatic GC is usually sufficient.
- Use with `runtime.MemStats` to monitor memory before/after:
  ```go title="Go"
  var m runtime.MemStats
  runtime.ReadMemStats(&m)
  fmt.Printf("HeapAlloc: %v bytes\n", m.HeapAlloc)
  ```
- Profile with `pprof` to assess GC impact.
- Test with `-race` for concurrency safety.
- Use sparingly, as it may increase latency.

This aids memory management in Go backend applications.

## What is write barrier in GC?

**Write Barrier in Garbage Collection**

A write barrier in Go’s garbage collector (GC) ensures memory consistency during concurrent garbage collection.

**Definition**:

- A write barrier is a mechanism that tracks object references modified during GC’s mark phase, ensuring no live objects are missed.

**How It Works**:

- Go uses a concurrent mark-and-sweep GC with a tri-color algorithm (white, grey, black objects).
- During the mark phase, the write barrier intercepts writes to the heap (e.g., pointer updates).
- If a goroutine modifies a pointer to reference a white (unmarked) object, the write barrier marks the object grey, ensuring it’s scanned before being collected.
- Example: Assigning a pointer in a struct triggers the write barrier:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Node struct{ Ptr *int }
  n := &Node{}
  n.Ptr = new(int) // Write barrier ensures new(int) is tracked
  ```

**Key Features**:

- Enables concurrent GC by preventing lost references.
- Minimal overhead, optimized for performance.

**Practical Notes**:

- Automatic; no direct developer control needed.
- Monitor GC performance with `runtime.MemStats` or `pprof`.
- Test with `-race` to ensure concurrency safety.
- Optimize by reducing heap allocations to lessen write barrier work.

This ensures reliable memory management in Go backends.

## Explain concurrent GC phases.

**Concurrent GC Phases**

Go’s garbage collector (GC) uses a concurrent mark-and-sweep algorithm to manage memory with minimal pauses, operating in distinct phases.

**Definition**:

- Concurrent GC reclaims unused heap memory while allowing the program to run, using a tri-color algorithm.

**Phases**:

- **Mark Setup**: Initializes GC, enabling write barriers to track pointer updates. Minimal stop-the-world (STW) pause occurs.
- **Concurrent Mark**: Goroutines and GC workers mark live objects (white to grey to black) concurrently. Write barriers ensure new references are tracked.
  ```go title="Go"
  // Write barrier example
  type Node struct{ Ptr *int }
  n := &Node{}
  n.Ptr = new(int) // Marked grey by write barrier
  ```
- **Mark Termination**: Brief STW pause finalizes marking, ensuring all live objects are black.
- **Sweep**: Reclaims white (unreachable) objects’ memory, running concurrently with the program.

**Key Features**:

- Minimizes pauses via concurrency, targeting low-latency applications.
- Write barriers maintain consistency during marking.
- Controlled by `GOGC` (default 100) for frequency tuning.

**Practical Notes**:

- Monitor with `runtime.MemStats` or `pprof` for GC performance.
- Reduce allocations to lower GC load.
- Test with `-race` for concurrency safety.

This ensures efficient memory management in Go backends.

## How do you tune GC?

**Tuning Garbage Collection**

Tuning Go’s garbage collector (GC) optimizes memory usage and latency for backend applications.

**Key Strategies**:

- **Adjust GOGC**: The `GOGC` environment variable controls GC frequency (default 100, meaning GC triggers when heap doubles). Lower values (e.g., `GOGC=50`) increase GC frequency, reducing memory; higher values (e.g., `GOGC=200`) reduce frequency, increasing memory:
  ```bash
  export GOGC=50
  ```
- **Minimize Allocations**: Use value types, `sync.Pool`, or preallocated slices to reduce heap pressure. Check with `go build -gcflags="-m"`.
- **Monitor with MemStats**: Use `runtime.MemStats` to track heap usage and GC cycles:
  ```go title="Go"
  var m runtime.MemStats
  runtime.ReadMemStats(&m)
  fmt.Printf("HeapAlloc: %v bytes", m.HeapAlloc)
  ```
- **Manual GC**: Trigger with `runtime.GC()` for specific cases (e.g., after large deallocations), but use sparingly.
- **Profile**: Use `pprof` (`/debug/pprof/heap`) to identify allocation hotspots and optimize.

**Practical Notes**:

- Tune `GOGC` based on workload (low for memory-constrained, high for latency-sensitive).
- Test in production-like environments.
- Use `-race` to ensure concurrency safety.
- Combine with tracing (`runtime/trace`) for deeper insights.

This balances performance and memory in Go applications.

## What is slice header internals?

**Slice Header Internals**

A slice header in Go is a runtime structure that describes a slice, managing access to an underlying array.

**Definition**:

- A slice header is a struct containing a pointer to the array, length, and capacity.

**Structure**:

- Defined in the runtime as:
  ```go title="Go"
  type SliceHeader struct {
      Data uintptr // Pointer to the underlying array
      Len  int     // Number of elements in the slice
      Cap  int     // Capacity of the underlying array
  }
  ```
- Example:
  ```go title="Go"
  s := []int{1, 2, 3} // Slice header: {Data: ptr to [1,2,3], Len: 3, Cap: 3}
  ```

**How It Works**:

- **Data**: Points to the start of the slice’s segment in the array.
- **Len**: Tracks accessible elements (`len(s)`).
- **Cap**: Tracks total available elements from `Data` (`cap(s)`).
- Modifications (e.g., appending) update the header; if capacity is exceeded, a new array is allocated.

**Practical Notes**:

- Slices are passed by value, copying the header, not the array.
- Check allocations with `go build -gcflags="-m"`.
- Preallocate with `make([]T, len, cap)` to avoid resizing.
- Test with `-race` for concurrency safety.

This ensures efficient slice management in Go backends.

## How do maps handle collisions?

**Map Collision Handling**

Maps in Go handle collisions in their hash table implementation to manage multiple keys hashing to the same bucket.

**Definition**:

- A collision occurs when different keys produce the same hash, mapping to the same bucket in a Go map.

**How It Works**:

- **Buckets**: Each map bucket holds up to 8 key-value pairs and a `tophash` array for quick key comparison.
- **Collision Resolution**:
  - When keys hash to the same bucket, Go stores them in the bucket’s slots.
  - The `tophash` (top 8 bits of the hash) is used to quickly match keys.
  - If a bucket is full, an overflow bucket is created, linked to the original.
- **Lookup/Insertion**: The runtime checks `tophash` and compares full keys to resolve collisions:
  ```go title="Go"
  m := make(map[string]int)
  m["key1"] = 1 // Hashes to bucket, stored in slot
  m["key2"] = 2 // Same hash, stored in another slot or overflow
  ```
- **Rehashing**: Excessive collisions trigger map resizing to reduce bucket load.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use `make(map[K]V, hint)` to preallocate and minimize collisions.
- Profile with `pprof` to detect performance issues.
- Test with `-race` for concurrency safety.

This ensures efficient map operations in Go backends.

## What is map evacuation?

**Map Evacuation**

Map evacuation in Go refers to the process of moving key-value pairs from old buckets to new ones during a map resize operation.

**Definition**:

- When a Go map grows or rehashes due to high load factor (~6.5) or excessive overflow buckets, evacuation redistributes entries to new buckets.

**How It Works**:

- **Trigger**: Occurs when a map exceeds its load factor or has too many overflow buckets:
  ```go title="Go"
  m := make(map[string]int)
  // Adding many entries may trigger evacuation
  ```
- **Process**:
  - The runtime allocates a new bucket array (typically double the size).
  - Keys are lazily moved from old to new buckets during operations (e.g., insert, lookup).
  - The hash function reassigns keys to new buckets based on the updated bucket count.
- **Incremental**: Evacuation happens gradually to avoid performance spikes, with old buckets retained until fully evacuated.

**Key Features**:

- Ensures balanced bucket distribution, reducing collisions.
- Minimizes latency by spreading work across operations.

**Practical Notes**:

- Preallocate maps with `make(map[K]V, hint)` to reduce evacuations.
- Profile with `pprof` to monitor resize impact.
- Test with `-race` for concurrency safety.
- Monitor with `runtime.MemStats` for memory usage.

This optimizes map performance in Go backends.

## How do you implement custom allocators?

**Implementing Custom Allocators**

Custom allocators in Go manage memory allocation explicitly to optimize performance or control memory usage.

**Definition**:

- Custom allocators bypass Go’s default heap allocation (managed by the garbage collector) for specific use cases.

**How It Works**:

- **sync.Pool**: Use `sync.Pool` for reusable object pools to reduce allocations:
  ```go title="Go"
  var pool = sync.Pool{
      New: func() interface{} { return &Buffer{Data: make([]byte, 1024)} },
  }
  func process() {
      buf := pool.Get().(*Buffer)
      defer pool.Put(buf)
      // Use buf.Data
  }
  ```
- **Manual Allocation**: Use `unsafe` or `C.malloc` (via cgo) for low-level control, though rare:

  ```go title="Go"
  // #include <stdlib.h>
  import "C"
  import "unsafe"

  func alloc(size int) unsafe.Pointer {
      return C.malloc(C.size_t(size))
  }
  ```

- **Preallocated Buffers**: Use `make([]T, n)` or `bytes.Buffer` for fixed-size allocations.

**Key Features**:

- Reduces GC pressure by reusing objects.
- `sync.Pool` is thread-safe and simple for temporary objects.

**Practical Notes**:

- Prefer `sync.Pool` over manual allocation for safety.
- Profile with `pprof` to verify performance gains.
- Test with `-race` for concurrency safety.
- Avoid cgo unless necessary due to overhead.

This optimizes memory usage in Go backends.

## What is runtime.MemStats?

**runtime.MemStats**

`runtime.MemStats` in Go provides detailed statistics about the memory allocator and garbage collector state.

**Definition**:

- `runtime.MemStats` is a struct in the `runtime` package that exposes memory usage metrics for profiling and optimization.

**How It Works**:

- Read stats using `runtime.ReadMemStats`:

  ```go title="Go"
  import "runtime"

  func checkMemory() {
      var m runtime.MemStats
      runtime.ReadMemStats(&m)
      fmt.Printf("HeapAlloc: %v bytes\n", m.HeapAlloc)
      fmt.Printf("TotalAlloc: %v bytes\n", m.TotalAlloc)
  }
  ```

- **Key Fields**:
  - `HeapAlloc`: Bytes allocated and still in use on the heap.
  - `TotalAlloc`: Total bytes allocated (including freed).
  - `Sys`: Total memory obtained from the OS.
  - `NumGC`: Number of completed GC cycles.
  - `HeapObjects`: Number of live objects.

**Key Features**:

- Provides insights into memory usage and GC performance.
- Helps identify memory leaks or allocation hotspots.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use with `pprof` for detailed heap profiling.
- Call `runtime.ReadMemStats` sparingly, as it briefly pauses the program.
- Test with `-race` for concurrency safety.
- Monitor in production-like environments to tune `GOGC`.

This aids memory optimization in Go backend applications.

## How do you monitor runtime metrics?

**Monitoring Runtime Metrics**

Monitoring runtime metrics in Go tracks performance, memory, and concurrency to optimize backend applications.

**Key Methods**:

- **runtime.MemStats**: Collect memory usage stats (e.g., `HeapAlloc`, `NumGC`):
  ```go title="Go"
  var m runtime.MemStats
  runtime.ReadMemStats(&m)
  fmt.Printf("HeapAlloc: %v bytes", m.HeapAlloc)
  ```
- **pprof**: Use `net/http/pprof` for CPU, memory, and goroutine profiling:
  ```go title="Go"
  import "net/http/pprof"
  http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil) // Expose /debug/pprof/
  ```
  Analyze with `go tool pprof http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/heap`.
- **runtime Metrics**: Use `runtime` package for goroutine count (`runtime.NumGoroutine()`) or GC pauses.
- **Tracing**: Capture detailed execution traces with `runtime/trace`:
  ```go title="Go"
  f, _ := os.Create("trace.out")
  trace.Start(f)
  defer trace.Stop()
  ```
  Analyze with `go tool trace trace.out`.
- **External Tools**: Integrate with Prometheus and `github.com/prometheus/client_golang` to export metrics:
  ```go title="Go"
  http.Handle("/metrics", promhttp.Handler())
  ```

**Practical Notes**:

- Use in production-like environments for accuracy.
- Minimize `ReadMemStats` calls to avoid pauses.
- Test with `-race` for concurrency safety.
- Combine with Grafana for visualization.

This ensures effective performance monitoring in Go backends.

## Explain generics instantiation.

**Generics Instantiation**

Generics instantiation in Go creates type-specific versions of generic functions or types at compile time.

**Definition**:

- Instantiation is the process where the Go compiler generates concrete implementations of generic code for specific types.

**How It Works**:

- **Generic Code**: Define a function or type with type parameters:
  ```go title="Go"
  func Sum[T constraints.Integer](a, b T) T {
      return a + b
  }
  ```
- **Instantiation**: When called, the compiler creates a version for the specific type:
  ```go title="Go"
  result := Sum(1, 2) // Instantiates Sum[int]
  ```
  The compiler generates `Sum[int]` at compile time, replacing `T` with `int`.
- **Type Inference**: The compiler infers the type from arguments, or it can be explicit:
  ```go title="Go"
  Sum[int](1, 2) // Explicit instantiation
  ```
- **Types**: For generic structs, instantiation occurs when used:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Box[T any] struct { Value T }
  var b Box[string] // Instantiates Box[string]
  ```

**Key Features**:

- Compile-time process, ensuring type safety.
- Generates efficient, type-specific code without runtime overhead.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use `go vet` to verify type safety.
- Profile with `pprof` to check performance.
- Test with `go test` for correctness.
- Keep generics simple to avoid complex instantiations.

This optimizes type-safe code in Go backends.

## What are type arguments?

**Type Arguments**

Type arguments in Go specify the concrete types used to instantiate generic functions or types, introduced in Go 1.18.

**Definition**:

- Type arguments replace type parameters in generic code, telling the compiler which specific types to use for instantiation.

**How It Works**:

- **Generic Function**: Define with type parameters:
  ```go title="Go"
  func Print[T any](value T) {
      fmt.Println(value)
  }
  ```
- **Type Argument**: Specify the type when calling (explicitly or via inference):
  ```go title="Go"
  Print[int](42) // Explicit: T is int
  Print("hello") // Inferred: T is string
  ```
- **Generic Type**: Use type arguments in declarations:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Box[T any] struct { Value T }
  var b Box[string] // T is string
  ```

**Key Features**:

- Enables type-safe, reusable code without runtime overhead.
- Type inference often eliminates the need for explicit type arguments.
- Must satisfy constraints (e.g., `constraints.Ordered` for comparable types).

**Practical Notes**:

- Use explicit type arguments for clarity in complex cases.
- Verify constraints with `go vet` to ensure type safety.
- Test with `go test` to confirm behavior.
- Profile with `pprof` to check performance.

This enhances flexibility and safety in Go backend generics.

## How do you use union constraints?

**Union Constraints**

Union constraints in Go generics, introduced in Go 1.18, define a type set by listing specific types using the `|` operator.

**Definition**:

- Union constraints restrict a type parameter to a set of explicitly listed types in an interface.

**How It Works**:

- **Define Constraint**: Create an interface with a union of types:
  ```go title="Go"
  type Number interface {
      int | float64 | int32
  }
  ```
- **Use in Generic Function**: Apply the constraint to a type parameter:
  ```go title="Go"
  func Add[T Number](a, b T) T {
      return a + b
  }
  ```
- **Usage**: Call with allowed types; the compiler enforces the constraint:
  ```go title="Go"
  result := Add(1, 2)      // T is int
  result2 := Add(1.5, 2.5) // T is float64
  ```
- **Type Inference**: The compiler infers `T` from arguments, or specify explicitly: `Add[int32](1, 2)`.

**Key Features**:

- Restricts type parameters to a finite set of types.
- Ensures type safety at compile time.
- Supports `~` for underlying types (e.g., `~int` includes custom types based on `int`).

**Practical Notes**:

- Use for specific type restrictions in generics.
- Keep union lists small for clarity.
- Verify with `go vet` for type safety.
- Test with `go test` to ensure correctness.

This enables precise generic programming in Go backends.

## What is the approx constraint?

**Approx Constraint**

The `~` (approx) constraint in Go generics, introduced in Go 1.18, allows a type parameter to include types with a specific underlying type.

**Definition**:

- The `~` operator in a constraint specifies that a type parameter can be any type whose underlying type matches the listed type.

**How It Works**:

- **Constraint Definition**: Use `~` in an interface to include types with the same underlying type:
  ```go title="Go"
  type MyInt int
  type Number interface {
      ~int | ~float64 // Includes types based on int or float64
  }
  func Add[T Number](a, b T) T {
      return a + b
  }
  ```
- **Usage**: Allows types like `MyInt` (underlying type `int`) to satisfy the constraint:
  ```go title="Go"
  var x, y MyInt = 1, 2
  result := Add(x, y) // Works: MyInt has underlying type int
  ```

**Key Features**:

- Expands type sets to include custom types with matching underlying types.
- Ensures type safety while broadening compatibility.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use for flexibility with custom types in generics.
- Combine with union constraints for broader type sets.
- Verify with `go vet` for type safety.
- Test with `go test` to ensure correctness.

This enhances generic flexibility in Go backends.

## How do you interface with assembly?

**Interfacing with Assembly**

Interfacing with assembly in Go allows low-level performance optimization by calling assembly code from Go programs.

**How It Works**:

- **Assembly Files**: Write assembly in `.s` files, using Go’s assembler syntax (based on Plan 9).
  ```go title="Go"
  // add_amd64.s
  TEXT ·Add(SB),NOSPLIT,$0-24
      MOVQ a+0(FP), AX
      ADDQ b+8(FP), AX
      MOVQ AX, ret+16(FP)
      RET
  ```
- **Go Declaration**: Declare the function in Go to link with the assembly:

  ```go title="Go"
  package main

  import "fmt"

  //go:noescape
  func Add(a, b int64) int64 // Implemented in assembly

  func main() {
      fmt.Println(Add(2, 3)) // Calls assembly
  }
  ```

- **Build**: Use `go build` with `GOARCH` (e.g., `amd64`) to compile assembly.

**Key Features**:

- Uses `//go:noescape` to prevent stack checks for performance.
- Accesses function arguments via the frame pointer (FP).
- Supports architecture-specific code (e.g., `amd64`, `arm64`).

**Practical Notes**:

- Use for performance-critical operations (e.g., math, crypto).
- Test with `go test` to ensure correctness.
- Profile with `pprof` to verify gains.
- Avoid overuse; assembly is error-prone and non-portable.

This enables high-performance optimizations in Go backends.

## What is the plan9 assembler?

**Plan 9 Assembler**

The Plan 9 assembler is the assembly language syntax used by Go for writing low-level code, derived from the Plan 9 operating system’s assembler.

**Definition**:

- It’s a simplified, portable assembly syntax for defining architecture-specific code (e.g., x86, ARM) in `.s` files, integrated with Go’s toolchain.

**How It Works**:

- **Syntax**: Uses a unique, minimalist syntax with pseudo-instructions:
  ```go title="Go"
  // add_amd64.s
  TEXT ·Add(SB),NOSPLIT,$0-24
      MOVQ a+0(FP), AX // Load first arg
      ADDQ b+8(FP), AX // Add second arg
      MOVQ AX, ret+16(FP) // Store result
      RET
  ```
- **Go Integration**: Declare the function in Go to link with assembly:
  ```go title="Go"
  func Add(a, b int64) int64 // Implemented in add_amd64.s
  ```
- **Build**: Compile with `go build` for the target architecture (`GOARCH`).

**Key Features**:

- Supports `NOSPLIT` to avoid stack checks, reducing overhead.
- Uses frame pointer (FP) for argument access.
- Architecture-specific (e.g., `amd64`, `arm64`).

**Practical Notes**:

- Use for performance-critical tasks (e.g., crypto, math).
- Test with `go test` for correctness.
- Profile with `pprof` to verify performance.
- Avoid unless necessary due to complexity and non-portability.

This enables low-level optimizations in Go backends.

## How do you use runtime hooks?

**Using Runtime Hooks**

Runtime hooks in Go allow customization of the runtime behavior, such as scheduling or garbage collection, using the `runtime` package.

**Definition**:

- Runtime hooks are functions in the `runtime` package that let developers influence low-level operations like goroutine scheduling or memory management.

**Key Hooks**:

- **SetFinalizer**: Attaches a function to an object, called before garbage collection:

  ```go title="Go"
  import "runtime"

  type Resource struct{}
  func main() {
      r := &Resource{}
      runtime.SetFinalizer(r, func(obj *Resource) {
          fmt.Println("Resource cleaned up")
      })
  }
  ```

- **SetBlockProfileRate**: Controls block profiling frequency for contention analysis:
  ```go title="Go"
  runtime.SetBlockProfileRate(1) // Capture all blocking events
  ```
- **SetMutexProfileFraction**: Enables mutex contention profiling:
  ```go title="Go"
  runtime.SetMutexProfileFraction(1)
  ```
- **KeepAlive**: Prevents an object from being garbage-collected until marked:
  ```go title="Go"
  runtime.KeepAlive(r)
  ```

**Practical Notes**:

- Use sparingly; hooks are low-level and can impact performance.
- Test with `go test` to verify behavior.
- Profile with `pprof` to assess impact.
- Use `-race` to ensure concurrency safety.
- Document usage to maintain clarity in backend systems.

This enables fine-tuned control over Go runtime for optimization.

## Explain signal stack.

**Signal Stack**

A signal stack in Go is a dedicated stack used for handling signals (e.g., SIGSEGV, SIGTERM) to ensure reliable signal processing.

**Definition**:

- The signal stack is a separate memory region allocated for signal handlers, distinct from the goroutine stack, to avoid stack overflow during signal handling.

**How It Works**:

- Go’s runtime manages signals by registering handlers and allocating a signal stack per thread (M).
- When a signal occurs (e.g., SIGINT), the OS switches to the signal stack to execute the handler.
- Example: Go handles signals like SIGTERM internally, but you can customize with `os/signal`:

  ```go title="Go"
  import "os/signal"

  func main() {
      sigs := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
      signal.Notify(sigs, os.Interrupt)
      <-sigs // Handle SIGINT
      fmt.Println("Received interrupt")
  }
  ```

- The runtime ensures signal handlers run on a separate stack, avoiding interference with goroutine stacks.

**Key Features**:

- Ensures safe signal handling, even under stack pressure.
- Transparent to developers; managed by the runtime.

**Practical Notes**:

- Use `os/signal` for custom signal handling.
- Avoid signal-heavy logic; keep handlers simple.
- Test with `go test` to verify behavior.
- Profile with `pprof` for performance impact.

This ensures robust signal management in Go backends.

## How do you handle segfaults?

**Handling Segfaults**

Segfaults (segmentation faults) in Go, caused by invalid memory access, are typically caught as panics by the runtime.

**Definition**:

- A segfault occurs when a program accesses restricted or invalid memory, triggering a SIGSEGV signal.

**Handling in Go**:

- **Recover from Panics**: Use `defer` and `recover()` to catch segfault-induced panics:
  ```go title="Go"
  func handler() {
      defer func() {
          if r := recover(); r != nil {
              log.Printf("Recovered from segfault: %v", r)
          }
      }()
      // Code that might cause segfault, e.g., unsafe pointer access
  }
  ```
- **Avoid Unsafe Code**: Minimize use of `unsafe` package or cgo, common segfault sources:
  ```go title="Go"
  import "unsafe"
  var p *int
  *p = 42 // Potential segfault; avoid dereferencing nil
  ```
- **Signal Handling**: Use `os/signal` to catch SIGSEGV explicitly:
  ```go title="Go"
  import "os/signal"
  sigs := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
  signal.Notify(sigs, syscall.SIGSEGV)
  go func() { <-sigs; log.Fatal("Segfault detected") }()
  ```

**Practical Notes**:

- Debug with `pprof` or `runtime.Stack` to trace segfault causes.
- Test with `-race` to detect unsafe concurrency.
- Use `go vet` to catch risky code.
- Log errors with `logrus` for monitoring.

This ensures robust segfault handling in Go backends.

## What is the netpoll mechanism?

**Netpoll Mechanism**

The netpoll mechanism in Go manages network I/O events efficiently, integrating with the runtime scheduler for non-blocking operations.

**Definition**:

- Netpoll is Go’s internal system for polling network file descriptors (e.g., sockets) to handle I/O events like reading or writing, using OS-specific mechanisms (e.g., epoll on Linux, kqueue on macOS).

**How It Works**:

- **Integration**: The runtime’s scheduler uses netpoll to monitor network events, parking goroutines until I/O is ready.
  ```go title="Go"
  // Example: net/http server
  http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil) // Netpoll handles connections
  ```
- **Process**:
  - Goroutines performing I/O (e.g., `net.Conn.Read`) register their file descriptors with netpoll.
  - Netpoll uses OS polling (epoll/kqueue) to detect ready events.
  - When an event occurs, the associated goroutine is unparked and scheduled.
- **Non-Blocking**: Ensures goroutines yield during I/O waits, avoiding thread blocking.

**Key Features**:

- Scales to thousands of connections with low overhead.
- Transparent to developers; managed by the runtime.
- Optimizes concurrency by integrating with the scheduler.

**Practical Notes**:

- Monitor with `pprof` or `runtime/trace` to analyze I/O bottlenecks.
- Test with `-race` for concurrency safety.
- Use `net/http` or `net` for automatic netpoll benefits.

This ensures efficient network I/O in Go backends.

## How do you optimize network I/O?

**Optimizing Network I/O**

Optimizing network I/O in Go enhances performance and scalability for backend applications.

**Key Strategies**:

- **Use netpoll**: Leverage Go’s runtime netpoll (e.g., epoll on Linux) via `net/http` or `net` packages for efficient, non-blocking I/O:
  ```go title="Go"
  http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil) // Uses netpoll
  ```
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections with `http.Client` or `net.Dialer` to reduce overhead:
  ```go title="Go"
  client := &http.Client{
      Transport: &http.Transport{MaxIdleConns: 100},
  }
  ```
- **Buffered I/O**: Use `bufio.Reader`/`bufio.Writer` to minimize system calls:
  ```go title="Go"
  conn, _ := net.Dial("tcp", "example.com:80")
  writer := bufio.NewWriter(conn)
  writer.WriteString("GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n")
  writer.Flush()
  ```
- **HTTP/2**: Enable HTTP/2 with `http.ListenAndServeTLS` for multiplexing and reduced latency.
- **Timeouts**: Set deadlines with `net.Dialer.Timeout` or `context` to prevent hanging:
  ```go title="Go"
  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
  defer cancel()
  conn, _ := net.DialTimeout("tcp", "example.com:80", 5*time.Second)
  ```
- **Batching**: Aggregate small writes/reads to reduce network round-trips.

**Practical Notes**:

- Profile with `pprof` or `runtime/trace` to identify bottlenecks.
- Test with `-race` for concurrency safety.
- Use tools like `wrk` to benchmark performance.

This ensures efficient network handling in Go backends.
