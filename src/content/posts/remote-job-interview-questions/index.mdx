**Sample Answer:**

"To streamline remote tasks as a backend developer, I use automation tools like GitHub Actions and Postman to automate repetitive processes like CI/CD pipelines and API testing, integrating with tools like Jira and Slack to enhance collaboration across global teams.

For example, in my previous role on a remote team building a Node.js-based microservices API, I needed to ensure consistent testing and deployment across time zones. My task was to automate API testing to reduce manual effort. I set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically run unit tests and deploy code to a staging environment whenever a pull request was submitted, linking results to Jira tickets for tracking. I also used Postman to automate API endpoint tests, scheduling scripts to run nightly and sharing results via Slack for team visibility. This reduced manual testing time and ensured consistent quality.

The automation saved 10 hours of manual work per sprint and improved API reliability by 15%, with seamless async updates for global teammates. By leveraging automation tools, I enhance efficiency in remote workflows."
