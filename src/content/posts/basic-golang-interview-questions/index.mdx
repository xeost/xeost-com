Welcome to this comprehensive guide on 100 basic Go (Golang) interview questions. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, these questions cover essential topics to help you ace your next interview.

## What is Go, and why was it created?

**What is Go?**

Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language developed by Google. It is a statically typed, compiled language designed to be simple, efficient, and scalable, with a focus on modern software development needs. Go combines the performance and safety of a compiled language like C or C++ with the simplicity and ease of use of dynamic languages like Python.

**Why was Go created?**

Go was created in 2009 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson to address challenges faced in software development at Google and beyond. The primary motivations for its creation include:

1. **Simplicity and Productivity**: Developers at Google were frustrated with the complexity of languages like C++ and Java. Go was designed to have a minimalistic syntax, reducing boilerplate code and making it easier to learn and write programs quickly.

2. **Performance**: As a compiled language, Go produces efficient, native machine code, offering performance close to C/C++ while avoiding manual memory management complexities.

3. **Concurrency**: With the rise of multi-core processors and distributed systems, Go was built with native concurrency primitives (goroutines and channels) to simplify writing concurrent programs, making it ideal for scalable, high-performance applications like web servers and cloud systems.

4. **Scalability for Large Systems**: Go was designed to handle large-scale software projects. Its clear dependency management (via Go Modules) and fast compilation times make it suitable for large codebases and rapid development cycles.

5. **Reliability and Maintainability**: Go emphasizes strong typing, garbage collection, and built-in error handling to reduce bugs and improve code maintainability. It avoids features like implicit type conversions or inheritance to prevent common programming errors.

6. **Modern Infrastructure Needs**: Go was created to meet the demands of modern computing, such as networked systems, cloud computing, and microservices. Its standard library includes robust tools for networking, HTTP servers, and file handling, making it a go-to choice for building cloud-native applications.

In summary, Go was created to provide a simple, fast, and reliable language for building scalable, concurrent, and maintainable software, addressing the shortcomings of existing languages in the context of modern software development challenges.

## What are the key features of Go?

The key features of Go (Golang) that make it a distinctive and powerful programming language include:

1. **Simplicity**: Go has a minimalist syntax with a small set of keywords and straightforward constructs, reducing complexity and making it easy to learn and read.

2. **Static Typing and Compilation**: Go is statically typed, ensuring type safety at compile time, and compiles directly to machine code, resulting in fast execution and high performance.

3. **Concurrency Model**: Go provides built-in concurrency primitives like **goroutines** (lightweight threads) and **channels**, enabling efficient and simple concurrent programming for handling multiple tasks simultaneously.

4. **Garbage Collection**: Go includes automatic memory management through garbage collection, eliminating manual memory allocation and deallocation while maintaining performance.

5. **Standard Library**: Go has a rich standard library with packages for tasks like networking (`net/http`), file I/O, JSON processing, and cryptography, reducing reliance on external dependencies.

6. **Fast Compilation**: Go’s compiler is designed for speed, allowing quick builds even for large projects, which enhances developer productivity.

7. **No Inheritance, Simple Type System**: Go avoids complex object-oriented features like inheritance, using interfaces and composition instead, which simplifies code and improves maintainability.

8. **Error Handling**: Go uses explicit error handling with multiple return values, encouraging developers to handle errors directly rather than relying on exceptions.

9. **Cross-Platform Support**: Go supports cross-compilation, allowing developers to build binaries for different operating systems and architectures from a single machine.

10. **Go Modules**: Go’s dependency management system, introduced with Go Modules, provides reproducible builds and simplifies package management.

11. **Built-in Testing and Benchmarking**: The `testing` package supports unit tests and benchmarks, making it easy to write and measure the performance of tests.

12. **Tooling**: Go includes powerful tools like `go fmt` (code formatting), `go vet` (static analysis), `go test` (testing), and `go mod` (module management), streamlining development workflows.

13. **Interfaces**: Go’s interfaces are implicit, meaning types implement interfaces by satisfying their method sets without explicit declarations, promoting flexibility and decoupling.

14. **Portability**: Go programs are portable, with minimal runtime dependencies, making them easy to deploy across different environments.

15. **Open Source**: Go is open-source with a permissive license, supported by a large community and extensive documentation.

These features make Go particularly well-suited for building scalable, high-performance applications like web servers, cloud services, and distributed systems, while maintaining simplicity and developer productivity.
